<h2>Water Heater Services Folsom Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>To expose the elements for testing, remove the two metal covers, the insulation and the plastic covers on the side of the water heater. Your water heater will be installed the right way the first time. This maintains a positive pressure within your home and lowers your energy bills of other heating products since it does not use precious heated air while also ensuring that your water heater receives an unlimited supply of quality oxygen-rich air at all times.</p>
<p>While most homeowners are used to their tanked system, a tankless water heater offers improved performance while saving on energy costs. Configuration of water heater: some electrical systems and configurations may need to be updated to accommodate the voltage requirements of the new electric tankless system. Open a faucet to full "hot" to purge air from the water pipes and heater. We'll make sure the tankless heating units you select have the proper capacity and best feature set to support the hot water requirements of your specific industry.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Folsom</h3>
<p>Whether you need to replace or repair your water heater, Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning has the knowledge you need. Although tankless water heaters heat water on demand, they do have output limits on their flow rate. Gas water heater system installation (hot water heater system replacement) requires a plumber who is also a licensed gas fitter for the hot water system installation. Tankless water heaters are a higher initial cost, but they will cost less to operate because they only need to heat water as it is required and use less energy.</p>
<p>When you are ready for your shower you push a button and the pump sends the heated water from your water heater to your fixture more quickly than if you run the shower at full blast, and the pump shuts off when the hot water reaches it. Thus you save time, water, energy, and money. Tank heaters must always keep water warm after heating it. This process means that they continuously cycle on and off to keep water warm.</p>
<p>Condensing units have a cooler exhaust, and use less expensive PVC pipes. Old age - is one of the main reasons to go for water heater repair. 50 Gallon water Heaters that are run by electric are often a popular choice of homeowners and new home builders. One thing more, this kind of heater needs more maintenance than tank water heaters since the valves need some cleaning and lubricating every year. Let the team of experts at R.S. Andrews help you make the choice between an electric water heater and a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>When selecting a new water heater for your home, choose a water heating system that will not only provide enough hot water but also that will do so energy efficiently, saving you money. If not, building-wide pipes and water heaters will need to be fixed. Tankless water heaters produce heated water on demand, making it less wasteful, whereas a tank heater already has this hot water on hand. Sometimes you need to locate the heater so it will serve several fixtures.</p>

The hot water heater furnishes the hot water for showers, laundry and dish washing.</p>
<p>This soon eats up a lot of energy and eventually raises your electric and gas bills. Poorly installed electric wires can suddenly overheat and burn down your home. There is most likely a malfunction in your water heater and a replacement should be considered. There's no reason not to. You may think that because you live in an area that is generally colder and overcast much of the time that you cant use a solar hot water heater.</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Folsom Pennsylvania 19033</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>As such, this is the main reason you should focus on upgrading your water heater, as the old one is woefully out of date. Rheem Tankless  Water Heaters offer the savings, comfort and protection  you need. Most tankless water heaters can supply sufficient warm water to your entire household, but if your family uses a considerable volume on a daily basis, you'll want to make sure the unit you select is sized to meet your needs.</p>
<p>Once the heating elements fry, it usually costs about as much to replace the entire heater as it does to swap in new elements. Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
<p>Gas units are available in a large variety of models and sizes for both home and commercial use and range in output from 130,000 to 380,000 BTUs. Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
