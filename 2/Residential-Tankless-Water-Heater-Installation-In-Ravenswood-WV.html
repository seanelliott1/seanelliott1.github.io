<h2>Water Heater Services Ravenswood West Virginia</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>

<p>Large, bulky tank water heaters require storage space many of us can't afford. The best solar water heaters deliver stellar savings in summer, making them attractive for warm, sunny regions. Traditional water heaters typically carry 6 to 12-year warranties, while tankless heaters last around twice as long and can come with warranties of up to 15 or more years.

If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out.
