<p>Water heater repair in Lilburn for us at Mr. Rooter Plumbing has been a success story. To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house”-type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water. There is a heating mechanism at the bottom that heats the water which then rises to the top of the tank. Hot water tanks are rated for their Energy Factor” (EF) which measures how much hot water is produced per unit of fuel.</p>
<p>This scale comes out of the water at higher temperatures and then forms as a scale on the metal inside your tank. However, they are limited in the amount of hot water that can be produced at one time and they are more expensive to purchase than a conventional storage type water heater. We know the most common trouble spots that affect commercial hot water heaters. Where traditional units rust and leak, tankless water heaters do not.</p>
<p>Instead you'll have to remove the metal thermostat cover on the side of the water heater, pull out the insulation and hold the tester near the wires leading into the top of the high-temperature cutoff switch (see Figure A). Tankless units take about 15 seconds to bring water up to temperature, but you still have to wait for that hot water to arrive at your shower head or faucet, just as you do with a tank-type heater.</p>
