<h2>Water Heater Services Fairfield Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
<p>The cold water will enter the tank, then the water will be heated and then the hot water will be stored until there will be demands coming from the bathroom shower or tap, or the dishwasher or kitchen sink. Solar water heaters: These water heaters use the power of the sun to heat water. Just call us and ask us, Please fix my water heater problems!” and we'll be there soon to get your hot water running normally again.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Fairfield</h3>
<p>If the electronic ignition system breaks, the water heater won't come on and you'll end up with no hot water at all. We'll get there quickly and fix that water heater fast. However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement. One of the most common reasons for water heater repair is the lack of heated water.</p>
<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model. Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters can last up to 20 years but need to be maintained at least once a year. Once the water turns off, so does the tankless unit, saving energy and reducing wear and tear. As your water heater pulls water in, it's common that traces of sediment will deposit onto the bottom of your tank. Take note of the energy sources available to you, and the amount of hot water you expect to use.

Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>Turn Off On Its Own: If there issues within the tankless water heater than it can cause it to turn off on its own. Many of today's tankless water heater models are wi-fi compatible and can be monitored with a smart phone. In most cases, the water heater always gives way to the furnace thereby depriving you of hot water supply. A cracked or corroded storage tank is also a sign you need to replace your entire unit.</p>
<p>In addition to installing your new tankless water heater, we offer tankless water heater replacement service. If it's a conventional storage-tank water heater nearing the end of its 10 to 13-year life, replacement is obvious: New models are up to 20% more efficient and can save up to $700 in energy costs over the life of the unit. The installation cost for a tankless water heater is usually between $1,470 and $2,500.</p>

In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: Yes, most tankless water heater repairs require a professional. A great way to start changing the house from being less dependent on traditional energy sources and electricity companies to install solar hot water panels.
