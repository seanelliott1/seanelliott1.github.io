<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing.
