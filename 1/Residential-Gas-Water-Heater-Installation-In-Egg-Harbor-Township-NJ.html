You can be assured your local plumbing company is up-to-date with all local code requirements and safe installation practices: Local plumbers know when and how to pull a permit.</p>

You cannot run a short blast, or a fine trickle of water from the hot taps, as the tankless water heater will not activate under such a low demand flow. Deposits inside the heat exchanger can cause the outlets from the tankless system to become clogged. A heating element and a water storage tank are required in conventional heaters.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
