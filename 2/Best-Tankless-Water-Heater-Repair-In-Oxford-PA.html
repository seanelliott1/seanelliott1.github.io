If you are finding that your water is not getting hot enough or that it is running out quickly, it could be time for a new heating element for your water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker. Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model. Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>

With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>
