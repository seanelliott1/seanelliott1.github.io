Our plumbers have the experience and training to install, maintain, and service gas, electric, and tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to.

Tank-type water heaters consume energy on an ongoing basis to keep water hot in a tank. Sizing a regular tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater. Logic suggests that if you pay to heat water only at those peak times, it must cost less than heating water all the time.

<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, generate hot water only when you want it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater.

When it comes down to powering the heating process, tankless water heaters use 30-50% less electricity than water storage tank models.

With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>
<p>If the supply lines (gas and water) need to be moved that is the first major issue, then you have to think about the other details: replacing the exhaust pipe, a new concrete slab, a metal shed, earthquake straps, exhaust straps, and not to mention any flooring, ceiling and roofing repairs along with some hefty patchwork. Then your hot water tank is suddenly on the forefront of your mind. At Heil Plumbing, we constantly update our products to give homeowners and builders efficient water heater systems.</p>
