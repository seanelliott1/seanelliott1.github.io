While we can help you with all your plumbing repair needs, we also offer maintenance programs that can reduce the risk of emergencies and keep the water flowing day after day.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life. A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve. While your choice of water heater will cause a greater or lesser upfront cost, over time this will all average out to where you end up paying about the same over five years.</p>

Depending on the unit, this could mean both of your heating elements burned out or it could have a variety of other causes. It can be installed in an interior closet and replace that old tank type water heater. Every water heater manual ever written has a section regarding maintenance. There are many types of water heaters.</p>

<p>When your water heater breaks down, you want to call someone you can trust. Accordingly, the best place to install a tankless system is directly next to the water fixture. For a simple install with no need to run additional gas lines to a new hookup, an install will take an average of around 3-4 hours for a total installation cost of $150-$600. Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations. A gas water heater typically will have an EF between 0.50 and 0.80, with electric heaters around 0.90. A higher EF means more energy-efficiency and likely lower operating costs.
