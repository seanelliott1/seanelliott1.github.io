<p>All homes need to have hot water, and your water heater is what makes it happen. Don't wake up every day to a long wait for hot water—or worse, an icy cold shower. If you have an electric water heater, this will mean being wired into the home's electrical grid. Get valuable information if you are considering replacing your existing water heater with a new tankless water heater. If your water heater is older and you need frequent repairs to keep it running smoothly, a new unit is likely a good idea.</p>

If you feel the price of keeping your old unit may be getting out of hand, it's probably time to think about tankless water heater replacement. There are a variety of methods for heating water, so you need an expert to recommend the ideal solution for your home or commercial building.</p>

However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement. One of the most common reasons for water heater repair is the lack of heated water.</p>
<p>It'll take about 20 to 30 minutes to completely drain a 40 gallon water heater. Keep in mind that the tank size you need should be based on the maximum amount of hot water you will need during busy times, not on the storage room available for it. In some cases, you may have to switch to an outdoor model is the size you need can't be accommodated in the space available inside your home. There are several different factors worth considering before purchasing a new water heater.</p>
<p>Check the surrounding pipes for leaks that could damage the water heater. After the hot water tank in the system is an expansion tank installed to help keep pressure levels in the system at safe levels. Even when well-maintained, a tank-style heater will only last up to about 15 years, which means you'll have to spend even more replacing it. One of the most important, but also most unnoticed, appliances in your home is your water heater.</p>
<p>Storage water heaters lose heat and can cost a lot of money in maintenance over time. The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>
