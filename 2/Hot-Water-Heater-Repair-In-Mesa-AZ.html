<h2>Water Heater Services Mesa Arizona</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use. Water Heater- Install what you are taking out if you have a 40 gallon and want to upgrade to a 50 gallon now is the time to do it. If you do have a 50 gallon I DO NOT recommend switching to anything lower than what you have.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>

<p>January and November also seem to be good months to buy a water heater. Attach a new temperature and pressure relief valve to the heater. The electric tankless unit will only heat the water that you use and does not have the standby heat loss that typically comes with traditional tank-type products. If our water heater inspection determines that your unit has outlived its useful life or is damaged beyond economical repair, we may suggest a full water heater replacement.</p>
<p>The easiest way to brace a water heater is to install a pre-approved bracing system, which is available at most hardware stores. If the new tankless system replaced an Energy-Star storage-tank heater (its operating costs are $360 a year), it would take about 25 years to break even.

<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur. According to Home Depot, the chart below can help you determine how big of a tank water heater you need for your household.</p>
<p>This can happen if the gas supply is interrupted, the gas valve is turned off, or a gust of wind blows out the pilot light.

Call water heaters repair services. We see this a lot on traditional electric water heaters, which use a pair of electric heating elements to heat the tank. After your water heater tank has filled with water, turn on the circuit breaker at the main power box.</p>
<p>Not all water heaters can be repaired. The great news is that there are only a few things that can go wrong with water heaters because they have only a few parts.
