<h2>Water Heater Services Salem Alabama</h2>
<p>Below are some good reasons why you should consider a tankless hot water heater for your new or pre-existing home, office, workshop, or cabin project. There are other advantages to having a tankless water heater and that you will not have to worry about your young ones going down and playing with the facet that is on the outside of the water heater and taking a chance on getting burnt in the end with it. Plus you are not going to need to make sure that there is not unused hot water in your tankless water heater that would end up running the pipes in the long run.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>You'll be more than pleased with the results of a Show Plumbing tankless water heater installation, and you'll enjoy the system's benefits for years to come. The best heaters are those that have the best amount of insulation built into them. Permits are required on most water heater installs and pricing varies by province, city and municipality. Wait a few minutes to see if the water heater burner ignites. Or if your water heater is slow to heat or runs out of hot water faster than it used to, you may be able to make a quick fix by replacing the heating element.</p>

<p>Water is then heated by a copper heat exchanger fueled by gas or electricity, depending on your system. You're also not as limited when it comes to where your tankless water heater can be installed as they're safer. In addition to choosing a water heater with a good warranty, check consumer reporting websites and reviews from individual owners. The first step is to find an appropriate wall to mount the water heater to. For a whole house water heater, it makes sense to place it close to where most hot water is being used.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>

Our technicians have specialized training in tankless systems, which means we can address the areas of installation, repair, and replacement with equal confidence. Gas fired tankless systems produce hot water at a higher flow rate than electric tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>But because these tankless gas units last longer, the savings kicks in after six years, about when many tanks are nearing their demise. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger delivering it directly to your faucets or shower without using a storage tank. Whether you're in central Austin, or a surrounding city such as Lakeway, Bee Caves, Round Rock, Westlake Hills or Georgetown, TX, there is always potential for your water heater to experience one of these issues.</p>
