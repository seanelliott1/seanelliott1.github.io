<p>Many individuals are curious as to when do you need a new water heater. Call Lee's Plumbing: Once the plumbing experts arrive, they will assess the situation and walk you through the necessary repairs. These systems heat the water as it is requested, which is why they are also known as on demand” water heaters. Tankless models only require enough power to heat the amount of water needed at any given moment, meaning they use less energy, which translates to utility savings.

<p>Propane is available as both traditional tank water heaters starting at $560, and tankless products beginning around $600, other options include a single, wall-mounted, tankless, 1.5 GPM shower unit with a battery powered igniter and a showerhead for approximately $110. A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
