<h2>Water Heater Services La Grande Oregon</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>The Energy Factor (EF) rating on the label will tell you have efficient the hot water heater is at transferring heat from the energy source to the water. If you feel warmth, your water heater is probably working. If your heater is electric or gas, we will talk you through our tankless water heater installation. Consumer Reports recently tested several electric and gas whole-house tankless water heaters from brands such as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment. If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional. Gas units are often a little higher costs for installation because of the venting required. If the water starts out in the middle of the heater for instance, it will leave the heater after only being in the pipe for half the time it would need to reach full temperature.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation La Grande</h3>
<p>Directly connected to the water heater (no shut-off valve nor pressure reducer), it balances out the pressure inside the appliance. New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>If you have water on the floor or on top of the unit (this is different from water leaking from a supply line above the unit), you'll probably need a new water heater. This is because they don't deal with the stress of water stored in a tank and the continual need to use energy to keep the water heater. We will help you diagnose the problem and get your water heater started again.

Hybrid models function like conventional storage tanks, but they use a heat pump to extract energy from the air.

Another advantage is that tankless heaters have a longer life span those ordinary heaters.</p>
<p>Water heaters can be a costly investment for home owners that you'll be living with for over a decade. The final cost of having a water heater repaired will depend on the age of your water heater, the type of water heater, the scope of the problem and whether additional repairs to the natural gas supply, plumbing or electrical systems are needed. Tankless water heaters usually last 5 to 10 years longer than standard heaters.</p>
<p>Electric models run consistently, produce high energy ratings, and are easier to maintain than gas.

We also offer expert installations as well as reliable repair and maintenance services to keep your system working optimally.
