Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>

You don't have to worry about a water heater that is constantly heating up water, because the tankless water heater will only heat up the water that you need since it provides on-demand hot water. Although tankless water heaters are also called "instantaneous water heaters," they still take time to heat water, so after the trapped water was used up, you were left with a gap of unheated water.</p>

Many utility companies offer rebates on certain models of water heaters, generally those certified as low energy utilizing models.
