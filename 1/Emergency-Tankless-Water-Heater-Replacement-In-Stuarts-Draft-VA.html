Getting an oversized heater is a waste of money; while heaters with too low capacity will not supply sufficient hot water. The plumbers at Ben Franklin Levittown can also recommend the precise replacement heater needed for your water heater based on how many people live in your home within the budget you set. Our specialists can install, repair, tune-up, or replace any hot water heater. This saves energy, but could also waste water.</p>
