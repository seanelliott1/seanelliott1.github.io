<p>A plumbing problem isn't always an if emergency , but when it is, wouldn't you like to be protected? The first two problems are easy to rectify and do not necessarily indicate any need for heater replacement.

<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Arnaudville</h3>
<p>Directly connected to the water heater (no shut-off valve nor pressure reducer), it balances out the pressure inside the appliance. New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
<p>IT Landes installs and services the industry's leading and most technologically-advanced brands of traditional high-efficiency, reliable central heating, air conditioning, and whole-house systems and equipment for year-round home comfort.

Moon Valley Plumbing offers a wide selection of water heater options, and we can also do water heater repair for whatever type of system you currently have.</p>

Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
<p>However, they can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30 percent, by only heating water when it is needed rather than keeping a tank of hot water constantly heated. This is known as standby energy loss and it's costing you money.

Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water every day, according to They also last about twice as long as a tank water heater.</p>
