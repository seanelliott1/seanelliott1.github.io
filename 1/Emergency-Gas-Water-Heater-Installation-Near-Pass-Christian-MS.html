<h2>Water Heater Services Pass Christian Mississippi</h2>
<p>All homes need to have hot water, and your water heater is what makes it happen. Don't wake up every day to a long wait for hot water—or worse, an icy cold shower. If you have an electric water heater, this will mean being wired into the home's electrical grid. Get valuable information if you are considering replacing your existing water heater with a new tankless water heater.

Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>

Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>If you are operating a shower at 2.5 GPM and a dishwasher at 2 GPM during peak usage, you home would require a whole-home tankless gas water heater that is rated for minimum of 4.5 GPM at a 65° F temperature rise. When it's near the points of use, the time taken by the hot water to travel from the heater to the fixture will reduce. We offer water heater repair services throughout the Orange County area.
