<h2>Water Heater Services Clinton Illinois</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>The size of the water heater must also be taken into account. Tankless: As their name implies, tankless, or on-demand water heaters, don't store water in a tank.

This means inspecting the water pipes connected to the water heater, cleaning any debris and dust, checking the thermostats and safety valves and flushing the system.</p>
<p>Indirect water heaters use heat from a boiler. Radiant heating is a type of heating setup where the heat is supplied by electric wiring or hot water tubes installed into or under the flooring, and sometimes walls and ceilings. The steps for replacing a propane water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. They use electricity to pump heat from the air or the ground to your water tank, using less energy than traditional water heaters.</p>
