<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
