Are similar to conventional units in that they both burn gas, exhaust flues and store hot water in an insulated tank. However, from time to time, something can happen which will require you to have to look for a quality water heater repair service.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection.

If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
