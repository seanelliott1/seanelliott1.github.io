<p>Energy Savings: Because these units only heat water when it's needed, you can save big on energy costs. Water heaters are essentially steel tanks with vitreous glass bonded to the inside to protect the steel from rust. Retrofitting a home with a tankless unit can be a complicated process as compared to traditional storage tank and may cost as high as $3,000.

If not, building-wide pipes and water heaters will need to be fixed. Tankless water heaters produce heated water on demand, making it less wasteful, whereas a tank heater already has this hot water on hand.
