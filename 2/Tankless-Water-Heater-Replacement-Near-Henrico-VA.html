<h2>Water Heater Services Henrico Virginia</h2>
<p>While the process of installing a tankless water heater isn't too difficult it is very different from the process of installing a standard tank water heater. Choosing the right team of plumbing professionals to maintain the flow of hot water to your home or business can be a challenging and stressful decision, which is why we're proud to have been the go-to professionals for many homes and businesses in High Point, NC since 1997. Electric water heater: Confirm that the circuit is off to the water heater, using a non-contact voltage tester, then disconnect the wiring connections and circuit cable from the water heater.</p>
<p>A 2-gallon expansion tank works with water heaters up to 50 gallons. The build-up of excess sediment inside your water tank may cause it to heat a lower volume of H2O. Multiple units can be plumbed in parallel to increase the volume output of hot water. 2. Tankless water heaters deliver hot water faster. Because tankless models can deliver better performance and energy efficiency - that's why. We are the most trusted HVAC contractor, providing professional water heater installation and repair services.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life. A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve. While your choice of water heater will cause a greater or lesser upfront cost, over time this will all average out to where you end up paying about the same over five years.</p>
<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Replacement Henrico</h3>
<p>If you just need to schedule maintenance on your existing water heater, Snappy Electric, Plumbing, Heating, & Air's expert plumbers is here to help.

Indirect water heaters cost $800 to $1,500 on average. If the buildup is left unattended and the tank has rusted, it is time for a new water heater altogether. Remember that water heaters for home use need lower electrical ratings compared to commercial applications.</p>
<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down. But as time passes by and your water heater is slowly decaying, you can expect its relief valve to lose its function. Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>

Our comfort advisors would be happy to discuss your new-build plans, assess your family's water heating needs, and help you make an informed decision about whether or not a tankless water heater installation would be right for your home.
