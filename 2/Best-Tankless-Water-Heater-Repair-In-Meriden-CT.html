<h2>Water Heater Services Meriden Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you've ever stepped out of a hot shower on a cold morning and were pleasantly surprised to discover a warm floor, you were probably experiencing radiant floor heating. While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>
<p>Replacing a water heater usually costs $500 to $1,800 for a replacement of the same style and size. Another feature for the tankless water heater is a unit with an increased flow rate. The greater the desired Temperature Rise, the less Gallons per Minute of hot water can be produced. Our team of professionals is highly trained, knowledgeable, and experienced in all water heater installations and repairs. Such installation may result in an explosion or fire, but sometimes there may be no other choices.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>

Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>
<p>Some people have certain preferences for what type of heater they buy, but other people have more practical reasons for the choice of what they choose to purchase.

Even if you aren't sure which type of water heater is best for you, we can evaluate your current plumbing system, hot water usage, and help determine which type of heater you need.</p>
