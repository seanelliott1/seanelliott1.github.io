<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Call us for 24-hour plumbing services in Odenton, MD. If the heater gets too hot or the pressure to great the T&P releases the pressure or heat and that valve needs to be replaced. This impressive life span—combined with the energy savings you enjoy year over year—helps you recuperate the higher upfront cost required to purchase and install a tankless water heater. Unless you have two or more water heaters, hot water in some part of your house means that the water heater is working.</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
