<h2>Water Heater Services Bethany Oklahoma</h2>
<p>A hot water heater problem poses a lot of stress to households in cold areas. Replacing the dip tube also requires removing the cold water pipe, and changing out the heating element requires dealing with 220 volt electricity, so if you're not experienced with plumbing and electrical work, it may be best to leave these jobs to your local master plumber In addition, any repair work needed for gas heaters is best left to a skilled technician in order to avoid the risk of fire, gas leaks, or personal injury.</p>
<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results. Failure to do so can result in poor water heater performance, complete water heater failure, and even health issues. With a Rinnai® tankless water heater you'll enjoy the total confidence that comes with more than 30 years of innovation, support and integrity. A tankless water heater not only offer on-demand hot water, but this type of water heater comes in both electric and gas options.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

<p>Gas water heaters are a little different from other types of water heaters, so it is important that the technician working on the heater has the right tools and experience. Water pooling around or under your water heater is a sign of either corrosion or a damaged part. Tankless water heaters are a cost effective option for residential or commercial water heaters. Everyday tank water heaters retain large capacities of water, commonly around 50 gallons at a time.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
<p>As with any home repair project, water heater replacement is largely dependent on the individual characteristics of the home in which it is being installed. Contact Parkway Mechanical online or call 219-942-6626 to schedule your tankless water heater installation.

<p>Dirty Pilot & Burner Assembly: Periodic cleaning prevents water heater outages. When replacing this equipment be aware of electrical shock and very hot water. Discuss the two types of water heaters with your plumber to weigh your options. We need to put the new water tank in place being sure that the hot and cold water sides are properly lined up with the plumbing as it was before. Homeowners with on-demand water heaters typically use 50 gallons or less of hot water each day.</p>
<p>The water heater is a fairly simple appliance. When the distance between heater and fixture exceeds 50 feet, look for units with a built-in recirculation pump, which saves water and reduces waiting time. If your water heater is leaking contact us and we can assist you in shutting off the leaking water heater to help minimize any possible water damage. Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, do not store water.</p>
<p>By installing it as a point of use water heater, you will get instant hot water as soon as you turn on the faucet. Generally, gas powered tankless water heaters heat water up at a slightly higher rate compared to electric powered ones. Alternatively, in an electric setup there is only a water storage tank, two heating elements and a thermostat control. They came right on time, discussed the options and proceeded to repair our water heater for far less than a new one.</p>
