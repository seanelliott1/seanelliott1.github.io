<p>Depending on your location and other components, you have a variety of options for powering your new water heater. A common misconception is that a water heater which has stopped functioning has to be replaced. With these units, you don't have to ever worry about a rusted tank that leaks. The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed.
