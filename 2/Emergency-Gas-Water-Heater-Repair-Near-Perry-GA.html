<h2>Water Heater Services Perry Georgia</h2>
<p>When it's time to replace your old water heater, you'll want it done fast and at a fair price. Gas hot water heater installation (hot water heater system replacement) is NOT a DIY (do-it-yourself) project. There is no need to wait until your hot water heater breaks down or becomes inefficient. Simply put, changing the size of your water heater is usually not an option in an RV. Install a shutoff valve to the cold water inlet. If you're relatively inexperienced, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>

Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process).
