<h2>Water Heater Services Shipshewana Indiana</h2>
<p>When it's time to replace your old water heater, you'll want it done fast and at a fair price. Gas hot water heater installation (hot water heater system replacement) is NOT a DIY (do-it-yourself) project. There is no need to wait until your hot water heater breaks down or becomes inefficient. Simply put, changing the size of your water heater is usually not an option in an RV. Install a shutoff valve to the cold water inlet. If you're relatively inexperienced, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
<p>It might seem like it would be easy to install a water heater, but it is actually a lot more complex than it looks. According to , For homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily, demand (or tankless) water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters.” Tankless water heaters (if gas-fired) will save homeowners over $100 annually the longer they remain in service.</p>
