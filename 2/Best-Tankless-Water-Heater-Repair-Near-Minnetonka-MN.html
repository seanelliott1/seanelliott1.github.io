<h2>Water Heater Services Minnetonka Minnesota</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>When a hot water tap is turned on, water from your pipes enters the water heater and passes through the heat exchanger. It provides you with enough hot water to wash your dishes and your clothes, to bathe and shower, and to heat the water for cleaning cabinets, mopping floors, washing your hair, and more. For the home that has an average consumption of hot water a 40 gallon tank is normally sufficient. Emergency Water and Gas Shut Off Valve - Also known as "WAGS".</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Minnetonka</h3>
<p>As a matter of fact, you can save up to forty percent on energy bills by using a heater that doesn't have a tank. DIY: there are many reasons the installation of a tankless hot water heater is not considered a do-it-yourself project for the average homeowner. Our expert technicians can advise you on whether or not a tankless water heater is right for you. Tankless water heaters can last for much longer, operating for nearly 20 years or more.</p>
<p>I spoke with a technician who has seen tankless water heaters fail due to hard water deposits in as little as two years here in Minnesota. Similarly, in case you find a pool of water on the floor where your electric water heater is installed, you should urgently call a plumber, as it again is a crisis situation. Make sure the water heater is completely full and all air bled from the system before turning the power back on or you will ruin the new elements by "dry firing" them.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>If your water heater is leaking or you run out of hot water quickly, we'll do our best to repair it, however, it may be time to replace it. If so, replace it with a new high-efficiency water heater from the plumbing experts at Oliver. You don't want to wait until your water heater explodes before you replace it. Also, the Dallas plumber will be able to make recommendations when it does come time to replace your old w. heater.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Minnetonka Minnesota 55345</h3>
<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank. If you want to save money, invest in professional water heater installation. Keeping your water heater in good working order is always the best first step.</p>
<p>Circuit breaker for an electric heater trips. Tankless water heaters are perfect for vacation and second homes that are not constantly occupied. Tankless water heaters also use gas to heat water; however, tankless systems heat water on demand instead of expending energy maintaining a full tank of hot water. The water inside of a tankless water heater is less likely to rust. This kind of heater can deliver a nearly endless source of hot water, because it's always heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>Riley - There is a bit more to installing a tankless than a standard heater. If sediment or rust has built up in your water tank, it could be smothering or insulating the element. Plus SMUD offers 1,000-$3,000 in rebates on these units making them the perfect choice for a new water heater replacement.

<p>I am sure that at least 50 percent of homes in the U.S. will at some time have to use their homeowners insurance to cover the costs of damages caused by busted water heaters. If this is the case then try to find the place which your pipe or tankless heater is frozen and thaw as soon as possible to prevent the pipe from bursting. The garage (free standing or attached) is one of those not-preferable locations for the water heater installation, but sometimes it is the only one.</p>
<p>If your water heater is malfunctioning, give Assured Comfort a call. Providing nearly twice the service life and exceptional efficiency, tankless water heating adds value to the home. You need to be extra careful when you are handling gas, even though it is safe once it is installed, it has the ability to cause quite an amount of damage if not handled in a proper manner.
