<h2>Water Heater Services Indio California</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether you live in a rented apartment or your own home, hot water heater technology plays a very important role in your everyday life. In the instance that there is not enough hot water and you have ensured that the tank is not leaking, you can flush the tank so that mineral deposits are not reducing its efficiency. If your water heater is exhibiting any of the above signs or if it has stopped working all together, it's time to call in your local professionals. Gas heaters are also historically less expensive than electric heaters to run. When repair costs begin to outweigh the benefit it's time to replace your tankless water heater.</p>
<p>While tankless water heaters cost more upfront, they help you save so much water that the costs you save from your reduced water bill can actually pay off your unit in just a few years. This may force someone down the cost-saving route before they've fully considered the benefits of a tankless system. Since in many instances you purge the cooled off hot water from the hot lines before you use the hot fixture, you want the hot piping from the heater to the fixtures to be as short as possible.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation Indio</h3>
<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. Following a "heavy use" industry standard test, we compared the performance of gas and electric tankless water heaters with the performance of their conventional tank counterparts.</p>
<p>If your water heater is approaching the ten-year mark, it's time to start considering replacement services. For commercial facilities including hotels, universities, and restaurant chains, problems with a hot water heater can have a huge impact on daily operations and must be avoided whenever possible. This type of heater can serve a virtually limitless source of hot water, because it's always heating a large amount of water.</p>
<p>You can install a standalone heat pump water heater or combine your water heater with your heating and cooling system, employing an air or ground source heat pump. Reverse the tank orientation so that water pipes do not travel over or near the electrical wiring. This will vary by location and complexity of the hot water system installation, so it pays to get about 3 quotes. With energy costs on the rise, it may be time for you to consider switching to tankless.</p>
<p>Even if a larger heater is available, there is always a size and weight consideration in an RV. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy. Through increased efficiency and regular maintenance and repairs tankless water heaters can positively impact your energy bills.</p>
<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Indio CA</h3>
<p>A tankless water heater warms up water as it passes through, eliminating the need for a bulky water storage container. Tank-type water heaters consume energy on an ongoing basis to keep water hot in a tank. Sizing a regular tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater. Logic suggests that if you pay to heat water only at those peak times, it must cost less than heating water all the time. After you have had your unit looked at by the specialist, they will probably suggest that you either repair or replace your heater.</p>
<p>Sensors usually tell the heating unit when a tap in the house is turned on. The water that passes through the pipe that passes through the heating unit is then heated to a specific temperature. Keep in mind, when it comes to water heater repairs, this is not the time to do it yourself. This video does a good job of illustrating how to make sure electrical current is flowing to the electric water heater. There are many other reasons why homeowners, ranchers and others choose to purchase a water storage tank including, fire protection, emergency water storage, water treatment, water reclamation, irrigation and livestock needs.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble with your existing water heater, schedule an in-home consultation and let one of our professional, licensed technicians inspect your unit. Tankless water heaters are far more efficient because they do not waste energy keeping water hot when there is no demand for it. Maintaining the temperature of a 50-gallon tank of water takes a lot of gas or electricity that is not needed with the in-demand style of water heaters.</p>
