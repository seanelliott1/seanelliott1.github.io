From inadequate water temperature to a complete lack of hot water, our technicians are trained to handle the problem.</p>
<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>The cold water will enter the tank, then the water will be heated and then the hot water will be stored until there will be demands coming from the bathroom shower or tap, or the dishwasher or kitchen sink. Solar water heaters: These water heaters use the power of the sun to heat water. Just call us and ask us, Please fix my water heater problems!” and we'll be there soon to get your hot water running normally again.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>

Higher Installation Cost - Additional vents, additional tankless units, upgrading a portion of your electric line to 240 volts, or updating the plumbing might be necessary. If your water heater is leaking or isn't heating your water well enough for your needs, call 800-950-4619 today. BVS Home Experts is the plumbing contractor Katy and West Houston residents call for water heater repairs and any other plumbing service.</p>

These kinds of tankless gas water heaters, like the Bosch 2400EO-NG natural gas outdoor water heater, helps eliminate the need for vents. Some of these issues can be addressed by installing a tankless water heater. For expert water heater repair in the Orange County area, look to your neighbors at Barker and Sons Plumbing & Rooter.</p>
