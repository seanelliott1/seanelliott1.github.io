Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters have been growing in popularity lately, especially with the new water heater energy efficiency regulations.
