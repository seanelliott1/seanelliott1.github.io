<p>Water heater replacement: Your water heater works harder than any other plumbing fixture in your Chicago home. Make sure that the gas valve is turned on. If you have a gas tankless water heater, find the gas valve ( seen here as the gas supply” ). If it's in the OFF position, just rotate the handle counter-clockwise to the ON position. First you're going to want to turn off the gas, power, and water supply to the tank.</p>
<p>Check the surrounding pipes for leaks that could damage the water heater. After the hot water tank in the system is an expansion tank installed to help keep pressure levels in the system at safe levels.

<p>Water heaters that are not installed correctly can leak, causing water and mold damage. If water does take a long time to get to a faucet, the real solution is to add a circulation system to your water's heat source. However, if you're in the market for a water heater upgrade or new installation, you may want to consider tankless water heaters. All hot water system installation must be done by a licensed plumber in accordance with hot water system installation regulations.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you find a water damaged spot, you can trace the water stain back to the problematic leaking pipe. Allow the tank to fill completely and then turn on the electricity or gas again. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, generate hot water only when you require it.

In fact, according to the National Association of Realtors , energy efficient upgrades such as tankless water heaters are among the top things that buyers are looking for in a home today.</p>
<p>When a hot water tap is turned on, cold water travels through a coil pipe into the unit.
