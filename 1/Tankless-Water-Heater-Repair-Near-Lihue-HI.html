<h2>Water Heater Services Lihue Hawaii</h2>
<p>I over heard a couple at a home improvement store asking a clerk why their 125 gal hot water tank wasn't doing the job. It keeps the water at the required heated level while the heater is turned on. It should be noted that, in this example, we generously gave the storage water heaters a 15 year lifetime. There are many reasons why you should hire a plumber for water heater installation. If you need water heater repair, you need Aire Serv. The main advantage of tankless models is that they only heat the water when you need it, so they don't waste energy keeping the water warm around the clock.</p>
<p>Here at Althoff, we have professional plumbers that can install any size water heater for residential and commercial buildings, and they have the knowledge, experience and skill to pull the required permits and properly install the water heater. If you are finding that your water is not getting hot enough or that it is running out quickly, it could be time for a new heating element for your water heater.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>
