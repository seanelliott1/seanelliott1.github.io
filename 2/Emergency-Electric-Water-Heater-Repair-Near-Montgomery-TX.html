<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>

<p>Thank you AC Plumbing Heating & Air for squeezing me in on a short notice to get my AC serviced. With a conventional water heater you are limited by the amount of hot water it holds. Rather than keeping a large tank of water warm around-the-clock until you need it, tankless water heaters rapidly heat the water you require right when you need it. This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
