Colder incoming groundwater temperature will limit the product options to the higher kW units, which require a larger electrical service and breaker size capacity.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82.
