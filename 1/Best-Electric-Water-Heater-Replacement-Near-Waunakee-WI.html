Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required. In many cases, cooler weather may result in the heater having to work harder to maintain the same temperature that it did in the warmer months.</p>
<p>Check out the most common problems to determine if a water heater repair or replacement is right for you. Electric water heater: Turn off the circuit breaker on the water heater's circuit at the home's breaker box.

<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters.

<p>Even if a larger heater is available, there is always a size and weight consideration in an RV. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy. Through increased efficiency and regular maintenance and repairs tankless water heaters can positively impact your energy bills.</p>

This is particularly true in cold weather climates: If the ground water being pumped into the tankless system is already very cold, it will take longer to heat up than a traditional system. Electric water heaters use electricity to heat water.</p>
<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss.
