<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
