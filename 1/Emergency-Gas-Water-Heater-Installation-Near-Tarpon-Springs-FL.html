<h2>Water Heater Services Tarpon Springs Florida</h2>
<p>Not many of us know a whole lot about water heaters or water heater repair. Electric heaters are often cheaper to purchase and the spare parts needed for repairs are usually easy to find and cheap to buy. Water heaters are one of the unsung heroes of the plumbing world. By no means does this list include everything that is and should be checked on a water heating system but, hopefully, it will help you to know more about your system than you knew before and protect you from harm. ENERGY STAR certified models are available for water heater tanks.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>Many people think that electric hot water heaters are very expensive, and there are commercials seen often that indicate that gas water heaters are a better choice because they cost less and they keep working when the power goes out. A broken unit can quickly leave you without any hot water, which is why it's good to know what warning signs to look for to get timely repair services. These replacement models have been designed to save on running costs by having no fixed pilot.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Repair Tarpon Springs</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>If your building inspector finds a non-direct vent heater installed in a confined space, you will probably be told to add 2 new penetrations through the wall (known as high-and-low venting) or you will be told to remove it until it conforms to the code requirements. Heating water amounts to nearly 20% of a home's energy costs, so making sure you have a reliable water heater helps you save energy and money.</p>
<p>The good thing is that they can be replaced; however, this is another instance where a professional plumbing tech should look the heater over to see if there aren't any other glaring issues. As such, the most dangerous problem that could ever occur would be a serious leak with your water heater. If you closed the hot water faucet, you should open it again, as well as the T&P valve This will help the water drain faster by allowing air into the tank.</p>
<p>Just call and ask us. (We have both plumbers and electricians) Our experts can repair your water heater and get the hot water flowing in your home again. This may be happening because the circuit breaker that controls the water heater has flipped off, the thermostat stopped working, or electrical elements are defective. Sometimes a serious hot water heater issue may be better resolved by just replacing your water heater.</p>

<p>Large, bulky tank water heaters require storage space many of us can't afford. The best solar water heaters deliver stellar savings in summer, making them attractive for warm, sunny regions. Traditional water heaters typically carry 6 to 12-year warranties, while tankless heaters last around twice as long and can come with warranties of up to 15 or more years. Storage tank is better than instant heater in terms of water pressure.</p>
<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed. A tank style heater stores a specific amount of water, keeping it heated at the temperature you choose, sending it along when you turn on the hot water faucet. If you have a gas power heater, you have to install it about eighteen inches off the ground. When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>
