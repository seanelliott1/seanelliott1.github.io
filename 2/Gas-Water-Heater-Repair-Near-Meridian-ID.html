<h2>Water Heater Services Meridian Idaho</h2>
<p>A plumbing problem isn't always an if emergency , but when it is, wouldn't you like to be protected? The first two problems are easy to rectify and do not necessarily indicate any need for heater replacement. Installing an eligible solar or electric heat pump water heater entitles you to STCs, which can be sold to registered agents or traded individually. If it's a gas water heater use your two pipe wrenches and disconnect the union, that is between the supply pipe and the inlet pipe or it might be a flared fitting.</p>

Traditional water heaters are constantly warming water throughout the day, even when you're not using it. Tankless units only heat what you need, efficiently, helping you save on costs. Most tankless water heaters burn either natural gas or propane fuel.</p>
<p>It might seem like it would be easy to install a water heater, but it is actually a lot more complex than it looks. According to , For homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily, demand (or tankless) water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters.” Tankless water heaters (if gas-fired) will save homeowners over $100 annually the longer they remain in service.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Installation Meridian</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>

The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>
