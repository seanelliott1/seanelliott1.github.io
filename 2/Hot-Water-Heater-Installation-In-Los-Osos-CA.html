Gas-powered heaters typically cost more than their electric counterparts; however, the gas heater will cost about a third less to operate—depending on how much gas the pilot light consumes in your model.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank. A water heater expansion tank is a must if your home runs on a closed water supply system. Water heater repair is what is required, hence get in touch with a plumber.
