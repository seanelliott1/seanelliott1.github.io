<h2>Water Heater Services Columbus Georgia</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through.

<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box).

Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required. In many cases, cooler weather may result in the heater having to work harder to maintain the same temperature that it did in the warmer months.</p>
<p>The new Federal Water Heater Energy Standards have produced a burst of energy in new water heater design and technology Here's a cool Infographic from the U.S. Department of Energy.

<p>The first thing to check is for any leaks or standing water near your water heater. If the pilot light is out, follow the instructions posted on the water heater or the details below here to relight the pilot light. Reconnect the wire that was removed from the heating element to perform the resistance check in the previous steps. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating costs.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters. Many manufacturer's and plumbers recommend that a water softener is installed when you have a tankless water heater.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Columbus Georgia 31907</h3>
<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts. You can expect to pay much less for your hot water when you use a tankless system. This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>
<p>An hour later the tank less water heater failed again. You can see these valves beside or above the heater. When buying an electric heater you need to consider three things, the voltage, the amperage and the circuit breaker. On average, propane water heater installation costs around $1,000-$1,500. FHR is a measure of how much hot water the heater will deliver during a busy hour. Check for evidence of water leaking from the new element(s).</p>
<p>If not give Haven Heating and Air Conditioning a call today to join our maintenance plan and have peace of mind that if there's an issue with your tankless water heater, we will be there to take care of it. Tank water heaters are the most common type of water heater. Therefore, they avoid the standby heat losses associated with storage water heaters. A water heater is a complex machine and one that is placed under a lot of stress during operation.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gas tankless water heaters need you to have the right kind of gas - which could either be propane or natural gas - before you install any unit. Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
