Smith electric tankless models perform with high efficiency ratings and groundbreaking designs.

<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>Thank you AC Plumbing Heating & Air for squeezing me in on a short notice to get my AC serviced. With a conventional water heater you are limited by the amount of hot water it holds. Rather than keeping a large tank of water warm around-the-clock until you need it, tankless water heaters rapidly heat the water you require right when you need it. This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
