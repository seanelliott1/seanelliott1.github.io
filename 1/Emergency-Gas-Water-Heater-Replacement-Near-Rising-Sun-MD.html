Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>

Your tankless water heater can provide you with endless hot water for years to come with the right repair and maintenance from Central Plumbing. What this example shows us, though, is that the upfront costs of a whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly 2 to 2.5 times more expensive than a high-efficiency gas storage water heater and a high-efficiency is less expensive to own than a conventional gas storage water heater.</p>
<p>These units can heat between 20 to 100 gallons of water. With this type of water heater, a huge amount of hot water can heated as needed instead of storing it in a tank. As such, rather than limiting your business's capabilities to the capacities of your storage tanks, a tankless water heater provides you with an infinite supply of hot water. But if the heater is already too old, and leakage is impossible to repair, then this will definitely mean replacement.</p>
