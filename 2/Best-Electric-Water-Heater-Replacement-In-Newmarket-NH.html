<h2>Water Heater Services Newmarket New Hampshire</h2>
<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>Heat pump water heaters qualify as tank-type water heaters and are powered by electricity. You turn on the shower and feel warm water at first, but then get blasted with several seconds of cold water before the temperature slowly climbs back up. Here's what happened: When the first shower ended, some hot water was remaining in the pipes on the way to the shower. Call your local water heating experts at B&B Heating & Cooling.</p>
