<h2>Water Heater Services Pageland South Carolina</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Your Atlas plumbing expert will explain your tankless water heater options. If you do choose water heater replacement, we'll help you choose the best new water heater for your home. These heaters are ultra-efficient and offer an energy and money savings compared to the traditional water heater. For all your commercial water heating needs, contact Parkway Mechanical online or call us at 219-942-6626. Hot water heater repair can be dangerous.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Pageland</h3>
<p>Sizing an everyday tank water heater can be easier than a tankless water heater. Now, you might be thinking: A recirculation pump in combination with a tankless water heater would cause a huge waste of energy due to frequent pumping and re-heating.” And you were right, if you wouldn't make use of some type of smart control. To avoid this problem, a larger unit can be installed. So they may not be able to fit into spaces where an old heater of the same capacity could go. Tankless gas heaters are about the size of a suitcase and hang on the wall.</p>
<p>One of the best advantages of an instant heating system is that you can heat up the amount of water you need and only when you need it. There is less energy wastage compared to heating a full tank of water, and reheating it again after it has cooled down. Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>
<p>In the worst case scenario, your hot water heater can explode and cause significant damages. Your traditional tank heater provides you with hot water after having to heat the entire tank's capacity - between 30 and 50 gallons. Our experienced plumbing specialists can perform any water heater repair that comes our way in Ocala. They continuously heat water so hot water is consistently prepared. Note: All plumbing installations must conform to the local plumbing code, so consult the local building department for requirements in your area.</p>

The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
