They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>

When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source. Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>In Denver, any plumber who is licensed by the Colorado Plumbing Board and the City and County of Denver can handle almost all water heater problems.

<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater can fit in those tight spaces and still give you endless hot water. Tank water heaters are available in two variants- gas and electric. Water heaters are one of the most essential plumbing appliances in any home, and Four Seasons Plumbing provides high-efficiency water heater installation services to ensure that your family will always have access to clean, hot water. So if you can handle the high initial costs, you can save more money in the long run by switching to tankless.</p>
<p>A tankless system is nice to have if you do not use a lot of hot water. Bradford White water heaters feature the Defender Safety System to ensure a long life and safe operation. The capacity of a water heater is determined by its first-hour rating,” which calculates the BTU output relative to the tank size.

<p>These are all symptoms of a failing water tank, and if you catch them early enough, you can avoid total failure by calling a hot water maintenance company for help. We suggest reading up on our Advantage Program to potentially avoid problems with your water heater. Keep in mind, however, that as a trusted water heater contractor, our most important goal when working on your project is to do it correctly, instead of quickly.</p>
<p>A concentric vent, which has an exhaust pipe inside a larger air-intake pipe, simplifies installation because only one hole needs to be cut in the wall. Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000. Hard water (meaning it has a higher mineral content) in San Diego and surrounding areas causes a scale buildup that can damage heating elements.</p>
