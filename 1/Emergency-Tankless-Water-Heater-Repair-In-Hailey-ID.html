<p>Homeowners looking to save on water heating expenses. Most gas tankless water heaters fall between 95,000-195,000 BTUs. Now though, if you need to repair or replace your heater, both Morco and Bosch have ceased production of these models. A standard water heater has to keep a constant supply of heat to the water inside the tank in order to have it at the right temperature when you need to take a hot shower or wash the dishes.</p>
<p>If you have ever done those things you might have found out that the T&P Valve wouldn't close properly after checking it and the water heater drain valve now leaks.

<p>The drain valve is located at the bottom of the water heater. And there are no large electrical power demands needed as with the electric heater. Not enough hot water may also mean that your water heater is on its last leg and needs to be replaced.

The venting system, for a gas heater, must be fully intact and functioning to ensure that poisonous gases are released outside the home.

Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
