<h2>Water Heater Services Caldwell Idaho</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
