<h2>Water Heater Services Liberty Kentucky</h2>

If you are sure you have gas, and replacing the thermocouple doesn't fix the problem, the gas control valve is about the only thing left to check. Tempering valve regulations that now require hot water tempering valves, to protect against scalding.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
<p>When it comes to water heater repair and replacement in Houston, we take the time to examine the issue, communicate, and determine the best solutions for your home and your needs.
