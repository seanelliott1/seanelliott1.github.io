For commercial facilities including hotels, universities, and restaurant chains, problems with a hot water heater can have a huge impact on daily operations and must be avoided whenever possible. This type of heater can serve a virtually limitless source of hot water, because it's always heating a large amount of water.</p>
<p>If you're using a gas-powered water heater, the burner assembly must be connected to the gas line. This is because the heating coils are in the pipes and ready to heat the water as soon as it is needed.

<p>The most obvious drawback to a tankless water heater is the higher cost for both the unit and the installation. When sediment has built up inside your tank or the heating element stops working, we might be able to repair it. Elements can corrode due to a higher mineral content in the water such as you typically find with well water. Tankless water heating technology checks all the boxes to a more comfortable home.</p>
<p>Efficiency is the name of the game at Payless Water Heaters, and that efficiency means one thing: less stress for you. If your unit is over 10 years old, constantly leaking, or needing consistent repairs, these could be indicators that call for a hot water heater installation.

<p>FYI - Some tankless units, such as those made by Rheem , are able to work with a standard ½-inch gas line, provided it isn't longer than 24 feet. A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater. In an instant water heater system, the water is already heated to the set temperature as it travels through the pipes. They heat water directly, delivering a continuous flow so you never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. Even with a tankless a.k.a. instantaneous water heater, you won't have instant hot water whenever you open the kitchen faucet or another outlet. The average energy savings and additional lifespan make tankless heaters a viable option for many homes. Generally as your heater ages sediment build-up will occur, decreasing the amount of hot water that the heater can produce.</p>
<p>So, if your current tank is larger than 55 gallons you will need to think about a new solution before it is time to replace your hot water heater. When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank. A power vent tankless water heater will function best when it is installed in an area with adequate airflow around it for combustion to take place. Before finding the right plumber, you should know everything that goes into the cost of repairing a hot water heater.</p>
