<p>There are several reasons for and against installing an electric tankless water heater. No two brands of tankless heaters are exactly alike, and an improperly installed unit will more than likely underperform. Call (855) 982-2028 to schedule your water heater repair service. Having an incorrect setting can cause your water to be too cold, too hot, or cause your heating elements to work constantly. If your tank is gas powered, you'll find gas connections below the tank at the pilot light. The idea behind this type of water heater is to reduce wasted energy by heating the water as it runs through the pipe instead of keeping it in a tank and spending energy to keep it at one temperature twenty four hours a day.</p>
<p>Rather than installing it in your utility room or basement, they are small enough to be installed in non-traditional spaces such as closets. Imagine this situation: Your hot water heater bursts.

If your plumbing or electrical system requires upgrading to permit the use of a tankless heater it can be extremely expensive. Water heaters are not simple appliances. This can add to the your water heater cost. This means that it will take much longer for your water to get hot while you run the faucet waiting for it.

<p>If you're considering installing a new water heater yourself, you may want to reconsider after you've been able to evaluate all of the risks.
