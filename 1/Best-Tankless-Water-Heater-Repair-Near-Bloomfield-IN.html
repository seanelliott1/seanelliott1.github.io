<p>This is especially true for those units that have gone without proper maintenance or repairs when needed. That's 2X the life of a traditional hot water heater. When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source.

<p>Unlike hot water tanks, which run out of hot water and need to refill and continue heating, tankless water heaters continuously provide a steady stream of hot water. Heat pump water heaters - Heat pump hot water heaters move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat directly for providing hot water. Visual deterioration - If your water heater tank is showing visual signs of a problem, then you should consider replacing it.</p>
<p>If the water tank of your heater itself is leaking, it has been irrevocably corroded from the inside.

Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>Choose a water heater with the longest warranty available. Fortunately this is a fairly inexpensive plumbing repair, and can help extend the life of your hot water heater. Tankless water heaters provide hot water as it is needed, and do not store hot water for future use like conventional storage tank water heaters do.
