<h3>Water Tank Repair Hauppauge New York 11788</h3>
<p>Whether we simply need to replace a broken part, remove excess sediment, repair the heating element, or do something else entirely, we'll make safety our priority. You waste more water because tankless heaters have to heat the water first since there isn't a tank full already waiting. Answers to this issue are turning up the heat dial on the water heater, insulating the hot water pipes, moving the water heater, installing a second water heater or adding a recirculating pump system.</p>
<p>If the heating elements are good, the problem could be with the thermostats or cutoff switch. A traditional hot water heater typically holds 40-60 gallons of water that is collected in a tank and then continuously heated until it's needed. For your convenience we even offer extended warranty coverage on parts and labor on all water heaters installed by All Seasons Comfort Control. We can review the benefits of a storage tank vs. a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. A tankless heater has a flow sensing device that is activated whenever a hot water tap is opened. A tankless heater only uses energy while it's heating water. Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>
<p>If it's your water heater, a repair isn't an option. Tankless water heater installation costs may be less than you think. The main disadvantage of tankless water heaters is their upfront cost (unit and installation) is significantly higher than tank-style heaters. We have seen our fair share of bad thermostats, heating elements, and check valves. You can change a thermocouple on most water heaters with only a small adjustable wrench.</p>
<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust. Beehive Plumbing has the necessary experience and tools to handle all water heater repair, whether they're commercial or residential.</p>
