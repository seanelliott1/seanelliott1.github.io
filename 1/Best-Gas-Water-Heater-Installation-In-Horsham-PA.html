<p>A typical solar system saves anywhere from 70% to as much as 90% of the total amount spent on heating water for home needs. In fact, a Rinnai tankless gas water heater uses up to 40 percent less energy than a traditional tank water heater. Our comprehensive service plan will make sure that your natural gas hot water system is fully maintained to keep it running at peak efficiency all year round. If your water heater was in storage closet, then you will be able to use this space for other things, such as household items and clothing.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>That's the number that tells you how much hot water the heater can deliver over a set period of time. By combining these costs over a pre-determined period of time, we are able to understand and compare the total cost of ownership.

Prices range from about $170 for small gas-fired units to more than $2,000 for high-output heaters that can supply two showers at the same time; $1,000 is about average.</p>

Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>Water heaters can be a costly investment for home owners that you'll be living with for over a decade. The final cost of having a water heater repaired will depend on the age of your water heater, the type of water heater, the scope of the problem and whether additional repairs to the natural gas supply, plumbing or electrical systems are needed. Tankless water heaters usually last 5 to 10 years longer than standard heaters.</p>
<p>Traditional storage water heaters. Less expensive to run - Because these systems only consume energy when there's a demand for hot water, they're more fuel efficient than storage systems, which must keep up a steady supply of heat to maintain water temperature. 1) I needed a unit big enough to supply me with hot water for at least one shower and sink running at the same time.

A properly installed and insulated conventional water heater will save you money on your energy bills without requiring any modifications to your existing ventilation, power supply, or gas supply.</p>
<p>A gas water heater can be used even during power outages, and are usually more ideal for a large family, as they have a fast recovery time.
