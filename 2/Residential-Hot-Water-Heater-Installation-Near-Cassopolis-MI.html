<p>Water heaters are so many and of various makes and designs that at times it might be difficult to decide on a particular make to buy for your home.

Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker.
