But if you use hot water only in the morning and in the evening, like most full time working people do, your energy bill will go down substantially. It is very common for water heaters to have sediment buildups, either if the water has a high amount of minerals or the heater get older. It allows for significant energy savings and an endless supply of hot water. With a tankless hot water heater installation, you will no longer have to heat water all day and night.</p>

<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>
<p>Tankless electric units have shorter life spans, on the order of 7 to 10 years. Your vent is undersized at 3”. This application requires a short water heater, a minimum of a 12” connector rise, 4” vent, and a new gas cock.

For larger households that use more than 86 gallons of hot water each day, tankless systems can be up to 14% more energy efficient than traditional water heaters.</p>

In that scenario the person is left waiting for the tank of water to become heated to the set temperature.</p>
