<h2>Water Heater Services Marlboro New Jersey</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>There are many components to a gas or electric water heater that may require adjustment to restore hot water to your home. The average water heater has a lifespan of 12 years.

Improper water heater installation can lead to a fire, flood or possibly death. Energy savings: Tankless water heaters are also called on demand” water heaters because they only heat water when there is demand for it; i.e., when a hot water tap comes on in the house demanding hot water.</p>
