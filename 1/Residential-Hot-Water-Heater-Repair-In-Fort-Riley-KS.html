<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Riley Kansas</h2>
<p>One of the most common investments a homeowner finds themselves required to make in a home is a new water heater.

Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion.
