<h2>Water Heater Services Highland Illinois</h2>
<p>Many consumers are choosing to upgrade their current tank water heater to the new and improved tankless water heater systems that are available. We provide everything from hot water tank replacement to water heater maintenance. I called and the very next day they came out and repaired my heating service and did an excellent job. As mentioned, installing a new water heater of any type requires expertise in electrical, gas, and plumbing. Colder incoming groundwater temperature will limit the product options to the higher kW units, which require a larger electrical service and breaker size capacity.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>This replaces the endless heating and cooling of gallons of water that a conventional tank water heater does throughout the day, which saves you from high energy costs and needing to limit how many people can shower at one time. For this reason, tankless systems are also called on-demand water heaters. At Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc.
