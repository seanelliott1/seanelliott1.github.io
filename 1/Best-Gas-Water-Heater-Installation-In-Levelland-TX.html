<h2>Water Heater Services Levelland Texas</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater. Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car. For our California customers we will also properly earthquake strap and brace the water heater as required by the California state code for earthquake safety.</p>

<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
