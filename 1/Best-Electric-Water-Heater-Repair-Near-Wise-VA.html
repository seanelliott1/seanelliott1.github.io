<p>Some people have certain preferences for what type of heater they buy, but other people have more practical reasons for the choice of what they choose to purchase. With many water pipes hooking to your heater and home's plumbing systems, you could cause more damage than good if you accidentally unscrew the wrong pipe. Even if you aren't sure which type of water heater is best for you, we can evaluate your current plumbing system, hot water usage, and help determine which type of heater you need.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
