Even though the water heater does show any signs of failure, it needs to be checked regularly to avoid any expensive repairs in the future. Mallick Plumbing & Heating is the Service Contractor of Choice in Silver Spring, MD and throughout Montgomery County. Storage tank water heaters have lower initial cost by a significant margin.</p>
<p>Tank water heaters are the most common kind of water heater. After that, the new water heater can be brought in and maneuvered into place. When setting up a space heating water heating system you need a higher output quick recovery unit for some systems, like an electric forced hot air handler serviced by a hydronic heating coil. In the end, it is putting more pressure on the water heater to work. Our maintenance free heating units help water temperatures stay at safe levels.</p>
<p>Many people think that electric hot water heaters are very expensive, and there are commercials seen often that indicate that gas water heaters are a better choice because they cost less and they keep working when the power goes out.

However, a tankless water heater can last 20 to 30 years. If you notice your water just isn't getting as hot as it's supposed to, it may be time for a water heater replacement. One of the most common reasons for water heater repair is the lack of heated water.</p>
<p>It only needs enough power to heat the amount of water needed at the time. A water heater is not only useful for your bath but also for your laundry, dishwashing etc. Replacement of a traditional water tank is usually needed because of the build-up of scale and rust on the inside of the tank. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently ready. While traditional water heaters maintain a constant supply of hot water for your use, a tankless unit heats water quickly on demand.</p>
<p>Years of constantly heating hot water for your home has put the tank under tremendous pressure, and cracks and fractures begin to form.

When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble with your existing water heater, schedule an in-home consultation and let one of our professional, licensed technicians inspect your unit. Tankless water heaters are far more efficient because they do not waste energy keeping water hot when there is no demand for it.
