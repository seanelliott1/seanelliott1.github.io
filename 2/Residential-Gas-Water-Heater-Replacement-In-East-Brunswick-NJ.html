<h2>Water Heater Services East Brunswick New Jersey</h2>
<p>Many consumers are choosing to upgrade their current tank water heater to the new and improved tankless water heater systems that are available. We provide everything from hot water tank replacement to water heater maintenance. I called and the very next day they came out and repaired my heating service and did an excellent job. As mentioned, installing a new water heater of any type requires expertise in electrical, gas, and plumbing. Colder incoming groundwater temperature will limit the product options to the higher kW units, which require a larger electrical service and breaker size capacity.</p>
<p>Highly efficient water heaters such as tankless coil and indirect ones use less energy than conventional units, saving homeowners money on their utility bills in the long run. Hot water can add up to 25% of your energy bill, so be sure to choose an energy efficient heating appliance. These signs could mean that it's time to look into water heater repair. While a tankless water heater can provide an unlimited amount of hot water, it can only provide a limited volume.</p>
<p>Gas-fired tank-type water heaters use a burner centered underneath the tank to heat the hot water storage tank, which in turn heats the water within the tank. You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy. Another reason for sticking with the more popular tankless water heater manufacturers is for the reasons of maintenance.</p>

<p>Tankless units eliminate the possibility of damage from flooding due to a ruptured tank. The answer to this question will depend on if your water heater has received regular maintenance or not.

Install the various fittings that come with the water heater. Estimate how much hot water your household uses during peak hours and look for a heater with a first hour rating (FHR) that meets your demand.</p>
<p>January and November also seem to be good months to buy a water heater. Attach a new temperature and pressure relief valve to the heater. The electric tankless unit will only heat the water that you use and does not have the standby heat loss that typically comes with traditional tank-type products. If our water heater inspection determines that your unit has outlived its useful life or is damaged beyond economical repair, we may suggest a full water heater replacement.</p>
<p>Conventional hot water heaters keep water in storage tanks at a set temperature and distribute hot water on an as-needed basis. Replace your standard water heater with an electric fired tankless water heater. Normally, gas-type water heater last up to 12 years. Hot water temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit can cause serious burns.
