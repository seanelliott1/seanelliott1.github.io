<h2>Water Heater Services Marietta Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>When a homeowner is unhappy with a tankless water heater, it usually concerns the issues above, and managing expectations about how their tankless water heater should perform. Before you buy, note the stem length required by your water heater model. How they work: Tankless systems heat your water on demand using gas or electric coils. They are also insulated to keep the water hot between heating cycles. It's time to replace your unit.</p>
<p>The new line of A. Smith electric tankless water heaters provide an energy efficient and easy-to-install solution for your home or business. Whether you have an electric or gas water heater, it needs something to cycle the heat on and off. This means that water heaters should be set above 115 degrees in order to prevent the build-up of the bacteria in the system. If your current water heater is old, it's likely a conventional tank water heater.</p>

<p>Directly connected to the water heater (no shut-off valve nor pressure reducer), it balances out the pressure inside the appliance. New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
<p>Scalding water is usually the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. What it means for you is that using a tankless electric heater you will never run out of hot water while in the shower. Sometimes individual units are used in a number of locations throughout a house, but most newer homes have one high-output tankless heater to supply hot water throughout the home.
