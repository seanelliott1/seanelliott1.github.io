<h2>Water Heater Services Willimantic Connecticut</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
<p>And obviously, tankless water heaters take up much less space than the hulking behemoth of an old fashioned storage water heater. Our water heater repair will fix problems with any make and type of burners and other heating parts. Request us today for a free estimate on installing a new unit. Environmentally Friendly: Improved efficiency also leads to a reduced carbon footprint, making a tankless water heater installation a great move to make your home greener.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Willimantic</h3>
<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. Following a "heavy use" industry standard test, we compared the performance of gas and electric tankless water heaters with the performance of their conventional tank counterparts.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>Our menu of home services includes HVAC Installation, windows, plumbing, duct, and Insulation. A typical lifespan for a Rinnai water heater is 20 plus years in a residential location and this is almost twice as long as a tank. A conventional tank constantly heats stored water, is good for high usage demands and is economical. Plumbers must get a special certification in order to perform gas plumbing services, and the average homeowner simply doesn't have the knowledge to do these tasks safely.</p>
<p>We were also rather lean with our 15 year estimated lifetime for the whole-home tankless gas water heater, which is suggested to last longer than 20 years and in fact carries a longer warranty then the gas storage water heaters. Installing our water heater is really as easy as reversing everything we just did. From repairs, installations, and upgrades, our technicians are known for getting the job done right every time.</p>

<p>Whether you need emergency repairs to your existing system, or are considering upgrading your hot water heater, we can help you understand the cost and energy saving benefits of the options available. Some models, known as single point units, install close to the water source and are fairly inexpensive to purchase and install. That varies with the location and design of the unit, quality of installation, maintenance schedule and water quality.</p>
<p>However, certain issues with your water heater may indicate that it's time for a replacement. Then hold the tester against the metal water heater shell. Calculating a regular tank water heater can be easier than a tankless water heater. However, any repair that's left unchecked could result in considerable water damage in your home.
