<h2>Water Heater Services Taft California</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work. While the water is draining out of the old heater, Unbox the new water heater. With over 50 years of quality customer service, we specialize in the repair of residential gas and electric water heaters, tankless and commercial water heaters.</p>
<p>Gas tankless water heaters have a longer life expectancy than traditional tank water heaters. At Green Hills Plumbing we offer quality tankless water heater installation and service. Numerous people don't consider purchasing a new hot water heater until their old ones break down, yet the newer models could end up saving the home owner money in terms of energy expenditures so purchasing one now might save money for the household.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store. In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>

If the inlet water temperature is 50° F (10° C), the necessary current through the heater should not exceed 3.25 gallons (12.3 liters) per minute. And if you don't want to be unexpectedly drenched in freezing water on a particularly cold morning, you need to know when to replace your hot water heater so that you can avoid such an uncomfortable, shocking situation.</p>
<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away.

<p>On the other hand, Gas or propane fueled tankless water heaters have better power efficient but more complex installation process. A tankless water heater system operates by using a line or pipe. Instead, heating elements are used that heat the water as it is needed. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models). Whether you choose gas or electric, there are many ways to get savings out of a tankless hot water heater.</p>
