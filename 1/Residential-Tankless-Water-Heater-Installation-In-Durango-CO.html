<h2>Water Heater Services Durango Colorado</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, installing a tankless system will be a good step at reducing your energy consumption and by just installing one, it will knock money off the utility bill. If it's a tankless water heater, we know how to repair it. All tankless units, regardless of the manufacturer, have similar issues and several common points of failure. The water heater has stopped working. Tankless Water Heaters use less energy by only heating the amount of water necessary at that time.</p>
<p>The conventional gas storage water heater is roughly $100 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over the same 15 year time period. This provides an endless supply of hot water regardless of how many people need to take showers, how much laundry needs to get done, or how often you need to run the dishwasher. Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Repair Durango</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters have several advantages over traditional tank-style water heaters. That is why here at Marc Francis Plumbing, we understand how problematic it can be when our water heaters stop working due to old age, leaks, or any other problems you may be experiencing. Some send the unit back others go ahead and install the tank realizing that for the most part the dents are cosmetic and as long as the glass liner is not damaged the water heater will work fine.</p>
<p>Talk to our experts today - we can help you choose a hot water heater that's not only energy efficient, but affordable. With a Rinnai tankless water heater, you'll put an end to rationing water and will never have to choose between taking a piping hot shower, doing a load of laundry or running the dishwasher again. It will pay back its installation in a few years thanks to its energy-saving performance, but it may not fit in with your current budget requirements.</p>
<p>We have extensive experience with tankless water heater services - from installation to replacement and everything in between - and our trained staff is dedicated to doing the job right the first time, every time. A home that has a water heater that's too small for its needs will constantly be out of hot water, and a water heater that's too big for the household is a waste of money. A tankless water heater system allows you to have the hot water you want on demand without any hassles.</p>
<p>That isn't a problem with us. We know all of the proper procedures for gas water heater repairs. Finally, your installer or electrician can connect your new tankless water heater to your home's electrical systems. The water doesn't pool in the tank as it does with a standard tank type of water heater where it must fill the tank to a certain level before the heating element even starts. No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.). Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>
<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Durango CO</h3>
<p>If you want to get an existing water heater replaced, add $500 to the overall cost. So call the pros at Liberty Plumbing to flush and clean your tankless water heater and ensure it's working efficiently and effectively for years to come. Now we are going to connect the water heater to the water, electricity and drainage. Energy and costs savings: according to the Chicago Tribune , the average annual cost savings of a tankless water heater compared to a traditional tank storage is roughly $116 a year.</p>
<p>In addition to providing expert tankless water heater repairs, we also specialize in installations and replacements. Other materials, including heat pumps and pipes, are not included in standard installation costs. In locations where water has a high mineral content, otherwise known as hard water, add a water softener to reduce the unwanted effects that those mineral deposits can have on the water heater tank.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters. Many manufacturer's and plumbers recommend that a water softener is installed when you have a tankless water heater.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Durango Colorado 81301</h3>
<p>Once that hot water is gone, you will have to wait for a new 30 or 50 gallon tank to be heated again in order to have hot water. Tankless units supply a steady stream of hot water with no waiting and no running short. This cuts down on the wait time for hot water, provides you with a limitless supply, and allows for the whole family to gain access to hot water without waiting for your tank to refill. A typical tankless water heater installation can take a crew of 2 technicians an average of 6-10 hours, depending on installation requirements.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home. However, a broken thermostat can also tip the water temperature in the opposite direction and can mean that your hot water gets way too hot. If you hear odd sounds when you use your shower, you should contact your water heater repair contractor because something is seriously wrong with the heater.</p>
<p>As long as a large enough water heater is installed, it's not a problem. Depending on the age of your water heater, the repair may be simpler and more affordable than you think. This means you could pay for two tank heaters in the same time a single tankless model lasts. The cost to install a new water heater ranges from $400 to $900 for a 40 to 50-gallon tank, and between $1,470 and $2,510 for a tankless. If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>
<p>If your water heater is malfunctioning, give Assured Comfort a call. Providing nearly twice the service life and exceptional efficiency, tankless water heating adds value to the home. You need to be extra careful when you are handling gas, even though it is safe once it is installed, it has the ability to cause quite an amount of damage if not handled in a proper manner. In many cases a professional plumber can have a water heater repaired in 2 to 3 hours, but this can vary depending on the problem.</p>
