While that might be true in some aspects, installing the gas pipes and vents needed for a gas tankless water heater may require a little bit more than your average or above average building skills. Optional in some installations, it is mandatory for a vertical wall mounted water heater in absence of load-bearing wall. If your home is regularly empty for long periods of time, switching to a tankless water heater will eliminate unnecessary water heating that takes place with tank-type models.</p>

With routine maintenance, you can avoid having to repair your water heater, and it will last much longer. When it comes time to replace yours, chances are, you'll pick the same type of unit - either gas or electric. It is estimated that 5-10 million hot water tanks go to the landfill each year.
