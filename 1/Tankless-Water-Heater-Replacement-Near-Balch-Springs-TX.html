The designs have one principle heat source shared between two other pieces of equipment, a tank water heater and an air handler and these make up a space heating water heater system. Flow rate is the amount of water that a tankless unit can heat at a given time. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use. Caccia, the third-generation plumber, says that once you make the switch, labor costs are less for replacing an old tankless water heater with a new one than for replacing an old storage tank with a new one.</p>
<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection.
