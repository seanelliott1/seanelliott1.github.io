<h2>Water Heater Services East Bridgewater Massachusetts</h2>
<p>When it's time to replace your old water heater, you'll want it done fast and at a fair price. Gas hot water heater installation (hot water heater system replacement) is NOT a DIY (do-it-yourself) project. There is no need to wait until your hot water heater breaks down or becomes inefficient. Simply put, changing the size of your water heater is usually not an option in an RV. Install a shutoff valve to the cold water inlet. If you're relatively inexperienced, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>The small device can be installed underneath a sink on the wall where hot and cold water supply lines are accessible. Another one of the advantages that comes along with using a tankless water heater is that it lasts a lot longer than your standard water heater. It is best to have a professional take care of these type of issues as there are electrical and water hazards involved in making these repairs. Having tankless heater in your house produces endless supply of hot water.</p>

Electric water heaters tend to be more energy-efficient than gas water heaters, but the cost of electricity can make the electric the more expensive choice. Whereas with a tankless hot water heater all you have to do is turn off the water supply to that location disconnect the supply lines and you are basically finished.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>Both electric tank and electric tankless water heaters have their specific advantages.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 3 water fixtures close together and have determined that one tankless system will be purchased for serving these fixtures. Higher installation cost: The upfront cost to install a new tankless water heater is more than a conventional storage tank system. These units, which heat water with thick copper rods, are quieter and about a third smaller than gas or propane tankless heaters. Compared with a tank-type heater costing $400 or so, a $1,000 tankless gas heater may save a household only about $100 per year, depending on how efficient it is and how much hot water is used.</p>

Hard vs. soft water If you have hard water and no water softener, cleaning a tankless system can be time-consuming. Use the links below to compare the prices of popular tank and tankless water heaters. Tankless units with digital connectivity let you adjust the temperature and monitor gas and hot-water usage on your phone. Tankless hot water heaters are rated by how many gallons of hot water they produce per minute.</p>
<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty. An undersized water heater may also be the problem if too much water is being used to heat it adequately.</p>
<p>We can repair all brands of water heaters, including those from major manufacturers such as AO Smith, Rheem, Bradford White, State, GE, Whirlpool, and more. Traditional heaters are also prone to failure that causes leaks and could possibly flood your home.
