<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters also known as Instant hot water heaters, do not store water. You may want to have another gas shutoff valve installed just prior to the unit being installed. If your plumbing or electrical system requires upgrading to permit the use of a tankless heater it can be extremely expensive. Water heaters are not simple appliances. This can add to the your water heater cost. This means that it will take much longer for your water to get hot while you run the faucet waiting for it. It's pretty clear that this will cause an increase in water being run down the drain, costing the home owner money, wasting one of our most precious resources.</p>

In addition to choosing a water heater with a good warranty, check consumer reporting websites and reviews from individual owners.

<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.
