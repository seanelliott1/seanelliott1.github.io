But if you use hot water only in the morning and in the evening, like most full time working people do, your energy bill will go down substantially. It is very common for water heaters to have sediment buildups, either if the water has a high amount of minerals or the heater get older. It allows for significant energy savings and an endless supply of hot water. With a tankless hot water heater installation, you will no longer have to heat water all day and night.</p>

Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store.
