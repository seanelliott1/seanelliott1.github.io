While a water heater replacement is needed on occasion, a lot of times homeowners and business owners don't know when a replacement is needed.</p>
<p>So some basic knowledge will allow you to troubleshoot water heaters of almost any age or manufacturer. They need a larger volume of water in order to provide a constant and convenient water temperature. Find the cold water line on top of the water heater and turn the gate valve off. All water heaters are required to have a temperature pressure release valve installed to release any excessive pressure that is built up inside the tank.</p>

Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
