<h3>Water Tank Repair Bell Gardens California 90201</h3>
<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank. Many a times, water heaters start with a slow leak at the base or around a corroded fitting, that is when you really need to get it checked.</p>
<p>Tankless gas heaters don't store water and so you don't pay to keep gallons of water at a high temperature as in the tanks of electric hot water heaters. When you're dealing with a broken water heater, AC unit, or some other indoor comfort issue, you want to make sure the company you call will work with you to fix it, and not just provide a service to mask the real problem.

<p>If your water heater is around 10 years old and it's got a major mechanical problem, replacement is usually your best option. Your tankless water heater can provide you with endless hot water for years to come with the right repair and maintenance from Central Plumbing. What this example shows us, though, is that the upfront costs of a whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly 2 to 2.5 times more expensive than a high-efficiency gas storage water heater and a high-efficiency is less expensive to own than a conventional gas storage water heater.</p>
<p>If the supply lines (gas and water) need to be moved that is the first major issue, then you have to think about the other details: replacing the exhaust pipe, a new concrete slab, a metal shed, earthquake straps, exhaust straps, and not to mention any flooring, ceiling and roofing repairs along with some hefty patchwork.
