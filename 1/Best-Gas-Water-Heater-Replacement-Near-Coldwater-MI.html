<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater.

<p>A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). Now that you've read up on how to drain your water heater, be sure the gas is turned off at the valve, not just at the control module. VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>

Depending on the position of your water hookups, you may not be able to use the oversized water heater at all. Traditional water heaters come with up to a six-year warranty. These gases are blown through a coil in the base of the unit, where incoming cold water can absorb most of the heat.</p>
<p>Type: Traditional water heaters tend to be most common. With all the choices on the market; tank or tankless, gas or electric, number of gallons, etc., your options may seem overwhelming. Experience and skills mean that you're getting the job done right, which helps to ensure that your water heater lasts as long as possible- they can have a lifespan of between 10-20 years, depending on various factors. If you need water heater repairs, installations, or replacements, our team of water heater experts can help you.</p>
<p>While new storage water heaters are more efficient, they have had to grow in size. But if you have a large family, you'll likely need the faster heating capability of a gas unit. Call water heaters repair services. We see this a lot on traditional electric water heaters, which use a pair of electric heating elements to heat the tank. After your water heater tank has filled with water, turn on the circuit breaker at the main power box.</p>
<p>The main advantage of using a tankless water heater system is that they eliminate the extra cost of keeping 40 to 50 gallons of water hot in a storage tank, so you waste less energy. Tankless water heaters only heat water on an as-needed basis and will never run out of hot water during normal operation. It may be time to consider a tankless system. When the gas fumes from a gas water heater travel up and out the draft diverter on top of the gas water heater, they go to the outside of your house through a vent.</p>
