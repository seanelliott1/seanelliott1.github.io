<p>It is so quick to heat and be replaced that you never seem to run out of hot water. Tank water heaters are a standard type of water heater. The tankless water heating system seems to be the best option as it significantly saves time and energy. Like our other services, your new water heater will be covered by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. This heat from the pilot flame causes a tiny electrical signal to be sent to the control valve, telling the control valve that there is a flame present so it's OK to let the gas through to the main burner when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. Even with a tankless a.k.a. instantaneous water heater, you won't have instant hot water whenever you open the kitchen faucet or another outlet. The average energy savings and additional lifespan make tankless heaters a viable option for many homes. Generally as your heater ages sediment build-up will occur, decreasing the amount of hot water that the heater can produce.</p>
<p>Your water heater is leaking: Any type of water leak is no good, but it can be especially bad if the water is coming from your water heater.

<p>We'll make sure that it can provide plenty of hot water for you and your family and that it meets or exceeds your energy efficiency goals. Efficiency: If your water heater is of an older make and model, upgrading to a new, energy-efficient appliance will pay for itself over time.

<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
