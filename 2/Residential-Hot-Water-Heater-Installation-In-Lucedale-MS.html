<h2>Water Heater Services Lucedale Mississippi</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results. Failure to do so can result in poor water heater performance, complete water heater failure, and even health issues. With a Rinnai® tankless water heater you'll enjoy the total confidence that comes with more than 30 years of innovation, support and integrity. A tankless water heater not only offer on-demand hot water, but this type of water heater comes in both electric and gas options.</p>
<p>The new line of A. Smith electric tankless water heaters provide an energy efficient and easy-to-install solution for your home or business. Whether you have an electric or gas water heater, it needs something to cycle the heat on and off. This means that water heaters should be set above 115 degrees in order to prevent the build-up of the bacteria in the system. If your current water heater is old, it's likely a conventional tank water heater.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Lucedale</h3>
<p>When your water heater fails, a brand new water heater may be called for, especially if your existing unit is very old. Call Epic Plumbing at (281) 815-2322 to schedule an appointment for professional tankless water heater repair and installation services in Pearland. Yes, some problems with water heaters can be repaired but not all. This cuts down on the water heater's efficiency and its ability to adequately heat the water.</p>
<p>Although there is an increasing number of homeowners who have successfully installed a tankless water heater themselves, manufacturers strongly encourage buyers not to. First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
<p>Older water heaters tend to have parts that wear out over time due to corrosion and rusting. Never put insulation on the tin draft diverter located above the gas water heate. Over time, the heating element may wear out. If you decide to invest in a refurbished tankless water heater system, you need to be prepared for disappointment and having to invest more money in the future. A properly sized electric tankless water heater can do this, but to do so it puts a large surge of demand on your electric service.</p>
<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Lucedale MS</h3>
<p>Our technicians carry many commonly utilized water heater parts on our trucks, which allows us to make repair promptly. The standard water heater only lasts eight to 12 years. Tankless water heaters, as their name suggests, heat water on-demand and do not maintain a supply of water. There are a variety of advantages to switching over to a tankless water heater. As the name implies, tankless water heaters eliminate the need for a bulky hot water tank by connecting directly to your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Our plumbers are water heater repair pros. We can find the problem and get your water heater leakproof in no time. Call or click today to schedule tankless water heater repair and start enjoying endless hot water again. Most manufacturers suggest the life expectancy of a water heater is eight to twelve years. If you only have electricity at your home, it is often cheaper to continue using that fuel source for water heating over paying to bury a propane tank or run a new natural gas line (if that is even a possibility).</p>
<p>Also, electric heaters last only about half as long as gas units: Typical warranties are three to five years. Repair your water heater. We work to provide you with long-lasting solutions, and always take the time to solve your plumbing repair issues the first time. You can replace these yourself following the manufacturer's instructions, or call a water heater service professional. The lime scale acts as an insulator, reducing heat-transfer efficiency (the fraction of heat energy that moves from the burner to the water) and increasing thermal stress, which can ultimately reduce the water heater's lifespan.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Lucedale Mississippi 39452</h3>
<p>This is the product that you probably first envision when you think of a hot water heater. If you notice any of the above issues occurring, you need a tankless water heater repair or a service visit. Switching to an energy efficient tankless system provides up to $1500 in tax incentives. For most single family homes, a whole house water heater will be sufficient, allowing you to have multiple bathers or a washing machine and dishwasher running at once.</p>
<p>If there is a similar problem with an electric tank-type water heater, no such explosion can occur. What it does is provide hot water on demand so you don't have to worry about the shower suddenly running cold. This water heater hangs on your wall and, instead of storing a large tank of water that is kept constantly hot-even when you're asleep or not at home-the tankless water heater produces hot water only when it's needed, as it's needed.</p>
<p>Some heater models come with an incorporated technology using which the water flow generates a pilot spark. This means that you will need a tankless heater for every water source. Call PSE&G's water heater experts 24 hours a day to get a free hot water heater replacement estimate right over the phone. Using multiple units is a way to custom fit tankless models to fit your needs and reduce wasted energy. You might not know it but a water heater can be very dangerous to you anyone residing in your house.</p>
<p>As long as a large enough water heater is installed, it's not a problem. Depending on the age of your water heater, the repair may be simpler and more affordable than you think. This means you could pay for two tank heaters in the same time a single tankless model lasts. The cost to install a new water heater ranges from $400 to $900 for a 40 to 50-gallon tank, and between $1,470 and $2,510 for a tankless. If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>
<p>Condensing water tanks that run on natural gas have a special flue that captures wasted energy. Solar heating systems come with a large up-front cost ranging from $2,500 to $6,000, before counting the average savings of $1,200 from the tax credit. At Lighthouse Mechanical Heating and Cooling, we offer a complete line of high-quality tankless water heater models, along with tankless water heater installation, maintenance and repair services to support all your water heating needs.</p>
