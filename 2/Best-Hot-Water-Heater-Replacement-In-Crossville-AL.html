<p>Water heater usage costs $150 to $700 per year. WATER HARDNESS: Scale deposits that form in a heat exchanger (or on electric heating elements) slow down heat transfer and constrict water flow. The plumbing runs from the heat exchanger in the hot water tank, to the expansion tank, up through the solar collectors above, down through the pressure relief system, and then finally back to the heat exchanger in the tank.</p>
<p>Purchase prices are closely tied to warranties, and longer warrantied water heaters tend to be better built and better insulated. Depending on the unit, a gas line may need to be run to the installation point, or you may need an electrician to upgrade a panel or wire the unit into place.

Our experts at Anthony Plumbing, the premier Plumber in Kansas City recommend replacing the heater before it starts displaying performance issues to save on heating costs. There will need to be two or three people to perform this stage, due to the size of the water heater and the height at which it will be mounted.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heater Installations also typically require a flush kit to be installed for maintenance purposes. Replacing the anode rod regularly will significantly increase the life span of the water heater. Popular water heater brands are popular because of their reputation, and brands vary in price. Consequently, a tankless water heater is able to deliver as much instant hot water as you need and not a drop more.</p>
