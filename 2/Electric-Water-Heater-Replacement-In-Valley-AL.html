There are many types of water heaters.</p>
<p>I spoke with a technician who has seen tankless water heaters fail due to hard water deposits in as little as two years here in Minnesota. Similarly, in case you find a pool of water on the floor where your electric water heater is installed, you should urgently call a plumber, as it again is a crisis situation. Make sure the water heater is completely full and all air bled from the system before turning the power back on or you will ruin the new elements by "dry firing" them.</p>

It takes a big burst of BTUs for a tankless heater to turn cold water into hot water in just a few seconds. We guarantee you a same-day repair and delivery services if you call us before noon. Considerations with this type of installation include the size of the system, since the combination system is going to be calculated for size differently than if you're installing separate space and water heating systems.</p>

They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>Please call us for more details to see if you can get a free estimate on your new water heater. Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
