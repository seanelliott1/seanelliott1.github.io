<h2>Water Heater Services Hyannis Massachusetts</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
