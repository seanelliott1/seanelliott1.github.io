<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Columbia</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>Our menu of home services includes HVAC Installation, windows, plumbing, duct, and Insulation. A typical lifespan for a Rinnai water heater is 20 plus years in a residential location and this is almost twice as long as a tank.

SoCo Heating and Cooling technicians know what to look for to see if your water heater repair is something simple, such as a thermostat adjustment or replacement, or something more serious like failed burners or calrods.

This indicates what sort of energy source is used to heat the water.</p>
