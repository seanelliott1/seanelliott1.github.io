Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>Hot water is hot water but it does make a difference in the ultimate price you pay in energy bills which type of hot water heater you choose.
