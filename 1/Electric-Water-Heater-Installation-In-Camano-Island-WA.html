<p>3. All tankless water heaters are pretty much the same. Electric units often require a 240 volt electric for the most efficiency. In less time than you would expect, hot water flows out ready to use just as if it came from a storage type heater. Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>So some basic knowledge will allow you to troubleshoot water heaters of almost any age or manufacturer. They need a larger volume of water in order to provide a constant and convenient water temperature. Find the cold water line on top of the water heater and turn the gate valve off. All water heaters are required to have a temperature pressure release valve installed to release any excessive pressure that is built up inside the tank.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you have multiple people showering or multiple appliances using hot water at the same time, you will need a larger water heater that delivers more gallons per minute. We know that it can be hard to find people who specialize in tankless water heater repair but we have the experts you need to get any repair done fast. To help you make the right decision about which kind to install, we'll explain how tankless water heaters work and point out some of their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 3 water fixtures close together and have determined that one tankless system will be purchased for serving these fixtures. Higher installation cost: The upfront cost to install a new tankless water heater is more than a conventional storage tank system. These units, which heat water with thick copper rods, are quieter and about a third smaller than gas or propane tankless heaters. Compared with a tank-type heater costing $400 or so, a $1,000 tankless gas heater may save a household only about $100 per year, depending on how efficient it is and how much hot water is used.</p>
<p>Less efficiency — the heater will have to use more gas or electricity to heat the water. The first is that the tankless water heater that you install must have a thermal efficiency that's greater than 90%. Plumbing Dynamics stands above the rest by offering plumbing service for emergencies, allowing customers to pay in any way that they can, and making sure that the job is taken care of properly the first time.</p>
<p>These are all symptoms of a failing water tank, and if you catch them early enough, you can avoid total failure by calling a hot water maintenance company for help. We suggest reading up on our Advantage Program to potentially avoid problems with your water heater. Keep in mind, however, that as a trusted water heater contractor, our most important goal when working on your project is to do it correctly, instead of quickly.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
