Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>
