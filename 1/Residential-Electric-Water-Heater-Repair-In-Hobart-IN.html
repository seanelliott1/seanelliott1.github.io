<h2>Water Heater Services Hobart Indiana</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you.

<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
<p>Older water heaters tend to have parts that wear out over time due to corrosion and rusting. Never put insulation on the tin draft diverter located above the gas water heate. Over time, the heating element may wear out. If you decide to invest in a refurbished tankless water heater system, you need to be prepared for disappointment and having to invest more money in the future.

<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank.
