<h2>Water Heater Services Long Beach California</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Long Beach California 90805</h3>
<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>
<p>We'll ensure that your new unit is properly installed and vented, that all safety features are in place, and that the finished work conforms to approved clearance, drainage and regulatory parameters. Tankless Water Heater: If you're looking for a more energy-efficient alternative to a gas water heater, a tankless water heater could be the right choice for your home. We will assess your current and future hot-water requirements and the condition of the pipes and drains that connect to your water heater.</p>
<p>So, if your current tank is larger than 55 gallons you will need to think about a new solution before it is time to replace your hot water heater. When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank. A power vent tankless water heater will function best when it is installed in an area with adequate airflow around it for combustion to take place. Before finding the right plumber, you should know everything that goes into the cost of repairing a hot water heater.</p>
<p>Instead of being limited by the capacity of a tank - like traditional units - a tankless unit heats water on demand, as needed. The number of model choices can be overwhelming, but Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating takes the time to understand your needs and ensures that the water heater you select meets current city, state and national rules. Loud pops or cracks indicate that the heating element is failing and needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Tankless water heater works rather differently from the conventional water heating system - it does not require a tank for hot water storage and it is more environment friendly as the system avoids standby energy consumption. Meeting increased hot water demands can be a challenge for traditional tank-style heaters. No matter the type, brand, or age of your water heater, our team can repair and maintain it. Our local technicians are licensed for gas, electric, and tankless water heater repair.</p>
