Leaving the issue unresolved will ultimately result in the second heating element not working as well. And when soldering or welding, remember to flush the pipes before connecting them to the water heater and that excess heat can cause damage to the unit.</p>

<p>Cold climate tankless water heaters may require extra labor to install. Energy isn't wasted heating water that can sit in a tank for hours or days. The tank water heater has been the primary mode of heating water for decades now and this method of water heating has gone unchallenged, until now. One of the biggest risks with tank-style heaters is, over time, minerals from hard water build-up within the tank which leads to corrosion and eventually leaks.</p>

<p>So, when your water heater stops working, you need professional help—fast. Once the union is disconnected disconnect the rest of the pipe ONLY on the heater you are replacing.

<p>Once that hot water is gone, you will have to wait for a new 30 or 50 gallon tank to be heated again in order to have hot water. Tankless units supply a steady stream of hot water with no waiting and no running short. This cuts down on the wait time for hot water, provides you with a limitless supply, and allows for the whole family to gain access to hot water without waiting for your tank to refill. A typical tankless water heater installation can take a crew of 2 technicians an average of 6-10 hours, depending on installation requirements.</p>
<p>Tankless gas heaters don't store water and so you don't pay to keep gallons of water at a high temperature as in the tanks of electric hot water heaters. When you're dealing with a broken water heater, AC unit, or some other indoor comfort issue, you want to make sure the company you call will work with you to fix it, and not just provide a service to mask the real problem.

<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained. Our energy saver installation service saves you time and energy.</p>
<p>It will also take a long time for the water you need to heat up, since it only starts to do so when you turn on a tap. While the water heater is filling up leave the faucets on so you can bleed all of the air out of the system. The main companies producing such heaters are Bosch, Rheum and Noritz. Tankless water heaters generally require a higher initial investment, but they are less costly to operate and provide additional benefits like endless hot water.</p>
<p>Depending on the service load of your home, you may need an electrician to install a larger breaker to provide you with enough power. Most tank-style water heaters won't live past 20 years. Press the probe tips against the terminals of the heating element (one probe to each screw). Energy efficiency of your water heater can be improved through its correct installation and maintenance.
