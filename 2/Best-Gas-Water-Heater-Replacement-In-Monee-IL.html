<p>It is also a good idea to check the anode when you flush the heater, if you make this a routine you will be able to replace the anode before it is completely gone. Also, because they are not heating 40 - 50 gallons of water 24 hours a day, tankless water heaters are less susceptible to leakage than tank-type water heaters. Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>

<p>When it comes to installation, manufacturers recommend that you have a professional plumbing contractor help you with this process. And no one wants to pay for an exorbitant electric bill for hot water never used. Many jurisdictions consider new water heater installation and replacement water heater installation a different type of job (i.e., a permit may be required for one, but not the other). A tankless water heater in a bathroom is a popular option amongst today's homeowners.</p>
<p>We were also rather lean with our 15 year estimated lifetime for the whole-home tankless gas water heater, which is suggested to last longer than 20 years and in fact carries a longer warranty then the gas storage water heaters.

<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Monee IL</h3>
<p>We service and install both gas or electric water heaters and tankless water heaters. To be sure your entire house is without hot water, check every hot water faucet and fixture. You can also install separate tankless water heaters for appliances—such as a clothes washer or dishwater—that use a lot of hot water in your home. Disconnect the water lines from the old water heater. Tank or tankless water heaters cost between $216 to $903 to repair, with an average cost of $552.</p>
<p>If your water heater is in a location that will cause damage to your home, you should strongly consider replacing it after 10 years (or before, if any of the following symptoms occur). With a gas heater turn the thermostat knob to the pilot setting. Tankless heaters provide continuous hot water, so gone are the days of the hot water running out mid-shower. Inadequate Water Flow: Another thing to be aware of is that if minerals build up in the tankless water heater, they can cause slow water flow from faucets and taps.</p>
<p>You need to make sure you are upgrading to a tankless water heater that operates on the same type of energy source. Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process). Always replace the dielectrics when installing a new water heater. Professional installation, which we recommend unless you are an experienced do-it-yourselfer, should cost about $150, part included.</p>

Looking at the pros and cons for each, a storage tank water heater, and a tankless water heater, you would also need to consider the requirements of your needs and then decide what best suits you. If maintenance is put off and your water heater doesn't get the care it needs, it will eventually lead to repairs.</p>
<p>The good news is that by deciding to do it yourself, you will be saving anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500 in installation costs. Depending on the weather and other components, you have several selections for powering your new water heater.

VIP Plumbing's professional plumbers are experts in sewer and drain services, fixture repair or installation, and well pump and softener service, installation & repair.</p>
