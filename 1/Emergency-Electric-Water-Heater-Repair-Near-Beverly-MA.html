<h2>Water Heater Services Beverly Massachusetts</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Regardless of how well you maintain and care for your water heater, the average life span of most water heaters is from 8 to 12 years. If you live in the following neighborhoods of Agoura Hill, Downtown, Forest Cove, South end, Malibu Junction, East Agoura, and Old Agoura, then you need to find plumbing services to help you repair your heater.

<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Beverly</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>Check out the most common problems to determine if a water heater repair or replacement is right for you. Electric water heater: Turn off the circuit breaker on the water heater's circuit at the home's breaker box. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down. But as time passes by and your water heater is slowly decaying, you can expect its relief valve to lose its function. Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>
<p>We understand that sustaining the flow of hot water is necessary for your home to run smoothly, so we offer a wide selection of water heaters to fit your particular needs. Some factors can impact this, such as hard water or a failure to schedule a tank flush and fill service. Give us a call to schedule your tankless water heater consultation today.

As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of time before your water heater will need to be replaced and it is always better to schedule it out than deal with an untimely breakdown. Replacing your hot water tank can be a costly venture. In comparison, the average life expectancy of an electric tank water heater is about 12 or 13 years.

The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source.
