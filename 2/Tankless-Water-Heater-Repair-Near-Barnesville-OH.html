<p>More and more people are choosing an electric tankless hot water heater over its gas and propane counterparts.

<p>Water heater type: Whole-home tankless units provide hot water to all plumbing fixtures in your home, while point-of-use (POU) units only provide hot water for a single appliance or area (like the kitchen or laundry room). The tankless heater is much smaller than a traditional tank water heater. Longer useful lives than storage tank water heaters.

<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it.

Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
