<h2>Water Heater Services Richmond California</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Not enough hot water - If you have limited hot water before it runs out, your heating elements are not properly doing their job. Most water heaters in New Mexico use natural gas and this means you have to burn combustible fuel to heat your water. You can achieve even greater energy savings of 27%-50% if you install a demand water heater at each hot water outlet. A conventional water heater burns money, as it is constantly heating water you don't use.</p>
