<h2>Water Heater Services Stone Mountain Georgia</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Water heater failure can happen anytime and may lead to your tank fully discharging, potential damage and temporary loss of service. Specialists from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning will help you reach your goals when it comes to water heating systems. The tankless water heaters also cause an increase in water wastage since you have to let the water run longer to get your hot water. Before finalizing everything, make sure that you do enough comparison with the existing heaters that are out in the market.</p>
<p>Just as soon as the overall temperature drops, the thermostat signals the heating element to work. Replacing your water heater can ultimately lead to saving you time, money and stress down the road. If you feel the price of keeping your old unit may be getting out of hand, it's probably time to think about tankless water heater replacement. There are a variety of methods for heating water, so you need an expert to recommend the ideal solution for your home or commercial building.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Stone Mountain</h3>
<p>If you have any of these issues, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. We offer hot water heater replacement services and can evaluate your system and make the necessary changes to get it up and running again properly. Tankless water heaters are a great option that you should consider when it is time to replace your worn out traditional unit. Lower initial cost - A traditional water heater installation can be half as much as a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>Our menu of home services includes HVAC Installation, windows, plumbing, duct, and Insulation. A typical lifespan for a Rinnai water heater is 20 plus years in a residential location and this is almost twice as long as a tank. A conventional tank constantly heats stored water, is good for high usage demands and is economical. Plumbers must get a special certification in order to perform gas plumbing services, and the average homeowner simply doesn't have the knowledge to do these tasks safely.</p>

No matter what you're looking for, we can help you source the right product and install it for you so you can start enjoying the hot water you need. On the bright side, modern water heaters are far more energy-efficient than older models.</p>
<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Stone Mountain GA</h3>

If you desire a commercial tankless water heater for the cost-savings, we will work with you to find the best model for your application.

<p>Exterior tankless water heaters, can be installed on an exterior wall to have no impact to the space or appearance on the interior of the home.

Propane water heater installation will cost you around $1,000-$1,500. When there is a demand for hot water in your home, water flow initiates a sensor in the water heater.</p>
<p>It can be complicated removing old water heaters because they can weigh over 150 pounds and can release scalding-hot water if handled improperly. Hot water heaters are available in different models that are powered by solar energy, gas and electricity. Water leaks usually are caused by leaking valves and plumbing connections, but they can also be related to tank problems. This model of heater can serve a practically unlimited source of hot water, because it's constantly heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>It can also involve the pressure relief valve, which is supposed to let water out only if the internal temperature and pressure get too high. The reason that repairs are so important is that they can fix the issue you are currently having with your water heater, as well as make sure lack of repairs doesn't lead to a whole water heater replacement. Tankless heaters are space savers, consisting of a tight arrangement of coils encased in an insulated box about the size of a carry-on suitcase.</p>
<p>A concentric vent, which has an exhaust pipe inside a larger air-intake pipe, simplifies installation because only one hole needs to be cut in the wall. Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000. Hard water (meaning it has a higher mineral content) in San Diego and surrounding areas causes a scale buildup that can damage heating elements.</p>
