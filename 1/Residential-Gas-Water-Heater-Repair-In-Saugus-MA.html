<h2>Water Heater Services Saugus Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>For that reason, Muccia Plumbing helps guide you on the proper size (in gallons), and the pros and cons of traditional tank or popular tankless water heaters. We'll get to you quickly, assess your needs, and get your water heater repair in Cherry Hill or Burlington completed ASAP. Some models provide a small reservoir tank so you have hot water for the few seconds it takes to heat incoming water on the fly. Starting at $44.99 a month, you can get a new, energy-efficient Rinnai tankless water heater-lifetime repairs and maintenance included.</p>
