However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Orange New Jersey 07050</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed. Enjoy your new water heater and the satisfaction you have in doing it yourself.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
<p>More expensive low-density elements are usually folded back like the one shown in Photo 5. These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>

We highly recommend having your water heater installed by a professional as it is a difficult and sometimes dangerous process. That's why when it's time to equip your new home, or replace your old water heater it's important to consider cost, efficiency, and longevity of your new water heater.</p>
