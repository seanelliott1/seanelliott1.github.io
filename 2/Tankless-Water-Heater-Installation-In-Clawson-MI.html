<p>FYI - Some tankless units, such as those made by Rheem , are able to work with a standard ½-inch gas line, provided it isn't longer than 24 feet. A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater. In an instant water heater system, the water is already heated to the set temperature as it travels through the pipes. They heat water directly, delivering a continuous flow so you never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>The further your water has to travel from the water heater to its destination, the more noticeable the gap. He will also show you the easy way to carry a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone.

Install your black iron gas piping with a shut-off valve and a dirt leg at the water heater. If someone is not home to turn off the water to the water heater when it fails, flooding is a distinct possibility. Modern water heaters are more efficient than older units, provide consistent hot water for more extended periods, and save you more money on your monthly bill.</p>
