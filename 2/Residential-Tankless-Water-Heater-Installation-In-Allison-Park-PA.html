<p>Our certified and licensed plumbers have been helping homeowners get the efficient and reliable access to hot water they need since 2002. Incorrect installation will cost you money, will decrease the life of the system, and may cause the warranty to be voided. Your Dr. Energy Saver dealer can evaluate your home and your water heating system to help you determine what the best options are for your needs. You can be assured your local plumbing company is up-to-date with all local code requirements and safe installation practices: Local plumbers know when and how to pull a permit.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are popular options for water heater replacements, and they're only going to become more popular as homeowners discover their numerous advantages. It could be as simple as adjusting the heat so the water gets hotter. When we manage an installation, we actually take the time to remove and drain your old unit before hauling it away. Tankless water heaters are usually powered with electricity or gas.</p>
<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Replacement Allison Park</h3>
<p>The optimal size of a water heater is based on the number of occupants in the house and the peak water demand. This means that tankless water heaters don't produce the same standby energy losses that traditional units do while they keep standing water warm and ready for use, which can save you hundreds of dollars on your energy bills. Rarely, both elements will test OK, but you're still not getting hot water.</p>
<p>Although still an efficient enough way to heat water, some of the problems cited with these storage tank water heaters include the heated water limits, the heating delays and maintenance problems.

Andrews water heater expert can prevent future system failure and potentially save you money by checking your water heater settings and setup for maximum efficiency and telling you about any potential tax breaks that you qualify for if you need a new water heater.</p>
<p>The power vent systems only need an exhaust vent, and the unit has to be installed in a location that provides the right amount of air required for combustion to take place. We'll provide basic information about some of your options by taking a look at two types of ENERGY STAR-qualified water heaters : high-efficiency gas storage and whole-home gas tankless. The following are symptoms that indicate you may need a reliable water heater replacement from Matheson.</p>

The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>

<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended.

<p>Turn on the circuit breaker and run the hot water heater to verify that it is heating the water effectively. Mount the tankless water heater securely to the platform. On the other hand, if you have a non-leaking water heater and no hot water, you can often correct that yourself without calling a plumber. What's more, there are certainly cost savings to replacing all traditional water heaters with tankless water heaters at the same time.</p>
