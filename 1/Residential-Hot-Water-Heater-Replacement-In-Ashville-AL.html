<p>In contrast, storage water heaters last 10-15 years. You can heat your home's water by installing a whole-home system or multiple point-of-use units. If you are having a problem with your water heater, get in touch with Amy Home Services for traditional water heater and tankless water heater service. Protect yourself against higher future replacement costs due to inflation and higher costs of living. Maintenance plays a big role in the lifespan of your water heater.</p>
<p>Water heaters that are not installed correctly can leak, causing water and mold damage. If water does take a long time to get to a faucet, the real solution is to add a circulation system to your water's heat source. However, if you're in the market for a water heater upgrade or new installation, you may want to consider tankless water heaters. All hot water system installation must be done by a licensed plumber in accordance with hot water system installation regulations.</p>
<p>You need to make sure you are upgrading to a tankless water heater that operates on the same type of energy source. Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process). Always replace the dielectrics when installing a new water heater. Professional installation, which we recommend unless you are an experienced do-it-yourselfer, should cost about $150, part included.</p>
