<h2>Water Heater Services San Rafael California</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment.

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this.

<p>Your water heater is leaking: Any type of water leak is no good, but it can be especially bad if the water is coming from your water heater. Most water heaters rely on a natural draft to draw combustion fumes up the flue. Turn off the cold water valve at the top of the heater. Disconnect the pipes and remove the water heater. Since everyone will have a slightly unique situation in reconnecting their water heater, let me just offer you some tips and lists that will help you to determine your best approach.</p>
<p>This is an area where tank-style water heaters have a significant advantage over tankless. Heater Cost - Can be 2-3 times more expensive than a tank water heater. We do our best to provide same-day services because we understand that disruptive plumbing issues can happen unexpectedly. There is no boiler or tank to keep the water hot, so it is heated as needed by your faucet or appliance. Most tankless water heaters require disconnect switches, which should be installed next to the water heater.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
