<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there.

Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Thank you AC Plumbing Heating & Air for squeezing me in on a short notice to get my AC serviced. With a conventional water heater you are limited by the amount of hot water it holds. Rather than keeping a large tank of water warm around-the-clock until you need it, tankless water heaters rapidly heat the water you require right when you need it. This can save you, on average, over $80 in hot water costs each year.</p>
