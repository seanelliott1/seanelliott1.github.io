<h2>Water Heater Services Boulder Creek California</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to hire a plumber for a water heater installation. Before you call the professionals, you can troubleshoot your malfunctioning hot water dispenser on your own. We take care of all your tankless water heater repair and installation services.

To remove the old water heater, shut off the valves on the two water lines (one inlet and one outlet) leading into the existing water heater.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>

<p>Not all water heaters can be repaired. The great news is that there are only a few things that can go wrong with water heaters because they have only a few parts. So that increases the installation cost even further. If you flush your tank heater annually and call for professional service when you experience any operational issues, you will ensure your heater the maximum lifespan. High Energy Bills: Your water heater, particularly if you have a traditional tanked unit, is one of the highest consumers of electricity.</p>
