<h2>Water Heater Services Morganton North Carolina</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries. A tankless water heater will last about twenty(20) years, while a conventional water heater may only last ten(10) to thirteen(13) years or less (depending on the quality of your water). He quickly identified the issue (lower heating element not working) and explained the situation (very old water heater) and my options to address in a very easy to understand manner.</p>
<p>A. Smith electric tankless water heaters can provide hot water on demand and energy savings, all while taking up less space in your home. According to , a tankless water heater is probably going to save you (at most) $1,800 over the life of the system. We recommend having your water heater serviced every year or two to ensure it's working as efficiently as possible. Comprehensive Installations: In addition to our water heaters, we offer expert services for booster pump installation as well as recirculation pump installation for your system.</p>

The use of WELS (Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards) 3 star rated water saving shower head is an important factor in saving water and energy whilst reducing the size and cost of the hot water installation required. As a rule, if you've spent half the cost of a new water heater on repairs, or if your water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to replace your unit.</p>
<p>Then, be aware that when full, a 200L water heater like this one will weigh 260 kg. Therefore, you will need to ensure it is very securely attached. Clogged drain repair might seem like something you can do yourself, but there are advantages to calling a professional drain cleaning company to help maintain your pipes. Water is typically heated to 120 degrees F, so if you are heating, for example, 55° F cold water to 120° F, you have a 65° F temperature rise.</p>
<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down. But as time passes by and your water heater is slowly decaying, you can expect its relief valve to lose its function. Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>
<p>The first thing you'll have to decide when looking at hot water heaters is what type of fuel source you want yours to use. The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>
<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Morganton NC</h3>
<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>
<p>In addition, you will benefit from adjusting your hot water temperature with the changing seasons to get the right temperature from the faucets. Manufacturers recommend that certified electricians or plumbers install tankless water heaters. Traditional electric hot water heater tanks take up as much as 16 square feet of floor space in your home, but a tankless water heater is very compact and can be fixed on almost any wall either inside or outside your home.</p>
<p>Your tankless hot water heater will provide as much or as little hot water as is needed at any given time. For every 2 water tanks you install, you only have to get 1 tankless water heater. Plus, improperly installed electric water heaters can leak steam that causes mold growth and water damage. Here we will install an electric model, which is less complicated to put together than a gas one. With its installation, purchasers also need to think about the plumbing connection of their houses.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Morganton North Carolina 28655</h3>
<p>Every year flush the water in your water heater - this simple procedure clears the tank of sediment build-up, prolonging the service of both the tank and the heating element. They do this by running the water across a series of heating elements and then directly to your faucet. The T&P deposit pipe should not be connected to a drain; if the valve opens and the water goes down a drain, you might miss early warning signs of a problem in your water heater that could worsen if not addressed.</p>
<p>Let us install your tankless water heater and keep your plumbing running smoothly. Gas is fed to the burner through a gas control valve and thermostat switch that are usually located toward the bottom of the hot water storage tank. They have trouble with hard water: Hard water is bad for any water heater, but the effects of hard water will negatively affect a tankless system quicker as the sediment builds up in its lines.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>
<p>If your tank is leaking or the water is no longer running clear, these are cases where you absolutely have to replace your heater altogether. Copy the nameplate data of the water heater to purchase correct replacement parts. As water heaters generally hold 50 gallons of water, a breakdown can result in a damaging flood. If repair is not an option, we will help you determine the best replacement. One set of coils is the water line, the other, the heating element.</p>
<p>Compare the water heater's STCs for Zone 3 and for Zone 4 with the minimum requirements. Tankless water heaters last an average of 5-10 years longer than tank heaters. Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
