Your hot water heater doesn't have to be a behemoth. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.</p>

<p>While traditional water heaters will typically have a lifespan of anywhere between ten and fifteen years, most tankless units can be expected to be in use for over twenty years. The tank is heavy, so you will probably want to have some very strong rope so that you can lower the old water heater down and raise the new one up. Our tankless water heater maintenance plans can make this easier, more convenient and less expensive to do while offering you priority service as a maintenance plan member.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>Using a tankless water heater can reduce these costs by up to 50 percent, for an average annual savings of $80. Quite a few water heater manufacturers advise that you flush your water heater at least once a year to decrease the accumulation of minerals. Connect a hose to the water heater's drain valve. In this article, I provide a comprehensive list of the pros and cons of tankless water heaters so you can make a well-informed decision based on your unique situation.</p>
<p>Of course, the TP valve or pipe could still be warm if the water heater stopped working within the last 3 or 4 hours because the water inside would still be holding some heat. Tankless heaters are much more expensive than ordinary water heating systems. Regardless of the type of water heater that is in your home, it is an inevitability that you will experience some kind of issues with it. Usually, this is in the form of no hot water coming out of your faucets or shower.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
