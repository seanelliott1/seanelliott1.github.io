<h2>Water Heater Services Northfield Ohio</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Whenever you are ready to move forward with your tankless water heater project, your plumber or licensed installation professional should be well versed in the current status of rebates available and add that information to his recommendations. We carry out full-service water heater solutions, including repair, installation, and replacement. It may take a few hours before your water heater if fully heated. This typically requires a larger diameter gas line for gas units or a higher voltage power supply for electric ones.</p>
<p>Direct vent heaters are slightly higher in efficiency over standard water heaters but are significantly less efficient than tankless water heaters. The statistical life expectancy of a storage tank water heater is 10-12 years, depending on care and maintenance. For those suffering from a leaky water heater, John Moore can even repair your water damaged walls and floors without the headache of dealing with multiple contractors.</p>

<p>By nature of the design, the Tempra® is nearly 100% efficient; converting 100% of the electrical energy it consumes into heat. When a hot water faucet is turned on, water flows through the tankless water heater. The burners can become dirty and clogged, which will cause them to have trouble firing, and you'll notice this by a drop in hot water temperature in the house. This thorough video, by Ron Hazelton, explains how a failing conventional water heater can cause debris in your water that clogs faucet aerators, shower heads, and other water-using devices.</p>
<p>If you have ever done those things you might have found out that the T&P Valve wouldn't close properly after checking it and the water heater drain valve now leaks. We also install tankless systems. We will come in and replace any old piping, fix you up with corrosion-free drain plugs, and install the most energy-efficient models built today. Install the various fittings that come with the water heater.

<p>That isn't a problem with us. We know all of the proper procedures for gas water heater repairs. Finally, your installer or electrician can connect your new tankless water heater to your home's electrical systems. The water doesn't pool in the tank as it does with a standard tank type of water heater where it must fill the tank to a certain level before the heating element even starts. No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.). Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>
