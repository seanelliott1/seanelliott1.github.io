<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Bohemia NY</h3>
<p>We are trained and equipped to repair and maintain all makes and models of water heaters. However, if you prefer to install your new water heater DIY-style, be prepared to spend a couple of hours in order to finish the whole setup. The first step in installing a tankless system is ensuring all components of the system are correctly designed including properly sizing pumps, managing water pressures, determining correct numbers of circulating units, and providing for freeze protection.</p>
<p>Efficiency is the name of the game at Payless Water Heaters, and that efficiency means one thing: less stress for you. If your unit is over 10 years old, constantly leaking, or needing consistent repairs, these could be indicators that call for a hot water heater installation. Also, know it's purpose because if it will only be running a kitchen sink, you can get away with a model that uses less energy and save a good deal of money.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>
