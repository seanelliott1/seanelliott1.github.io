Another danger you should be aware is excessive pressure inside your water heater. You may also want to take into account the convenience of having hot water on demand, rather than having to wait until a normal tank hot water heater brings the water to a comfortable temperature.</p>
<p>Electric water heater: Connect the circuit wires to the water heater leads in the electrical junction box on the heater unit. A propane appliance like a hot water tank is a little less forgiving of problems than some of the larger built-in units you would find in most homes, so ensuring it is properly cleaned and maintained will help it last longer as well as keep you safer. In many cases it is a simple fix and does not require a new hot water heater.</p>
