<h2>Water Heater Services Irvine California</h2>
<p>A hot water heater problem poses a lot of stress to households in cold areas. Replacing the dip tube also requires removing the cold water pipe, and changing out the heating element requires dealing with 220 volt electricity, so if you're not experienced with plumbing and electrical work, it may be best to leave these jobs to your local master plumber In addition, any repair work needed for gas heaters is best left to a skilled technician in order to avoid the risk of fire, gas leaks, or personal injury.</p>
<p>The climate can also affect how much the homeowner can save by opting for a tankless water heater. When it comes to your water heater, Radiant plumbers are equipped to perform maintenance, repairs, replacements, and also hot water heater installations. Tankless Water Heaters are much different from the traditional water heaters we have today. For example, electrical units don't need ventilation, so there's no need to install a ventilation line alongside a water line like you would with a gas unit.</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Replacement Irvine</h3>
<p>Multiple units can also be linked in parallel and centrally located to form whatever size heating system you need. For 24 hour tankless water heater repair in Torrance, Redondo Beach, Harbor City & surrounding areas call 310-530-6290. If the inlet water temperature is 50° F (10° C), the necessary current through the heater should not exceed 3.25 gallons (12.3 liters) per minute. And if you don't want to be unexpectedly drenched in freezing water on a particularly cold morning, you need to know when to replace your hot water heater so that you can avoid such an uncomfortable, shocking situation.</p>
<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model. Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>
<p>If you have a water heater with a re-circulation pump, we can check that the pump is working correctly and re-install the existing pump or replace the re-circulation pump if needed during your water heater replacement. If you depend on electricity to heat your water, you have another choice that's better than a conventional tank or a tankless water heater.

If you aren't comfortable working with gas or electricity, do yourself a favor and call a professional plumber.</p>
