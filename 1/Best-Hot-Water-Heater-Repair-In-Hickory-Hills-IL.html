<h2>Water Heater Services Hickory Hills Illinois</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>If there weren't a dip tube the incoming cold water would constantly be cooling down the heated water and you would think that something is wrong with the heater because you are quickly running out of hot water. Each hot water heater comes with a digital control pad that allows you to control the water temperature for various water outlets in your home or business. There are many different types of water heaters on the market.</p>
<p>Coat the threaded ends with pipe joint compound and screw the first nipple into the gas valve. We've taken a closer look at the best tank versus tankless heaters so you can narrow your search and find the perfect water heater for your home and lifestyle. Periodic water heater maintenance can significantly extend your water heater's life and minimize loss of efficiency. Water heaters are heavy. The fuel used by a water heating system will not only affect annual operation costs but also the water heater's size and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Tankless heaters can last up to 20 years but need to be maintained at least once a year. Once the water turns off, so does the tankless unit, saving energy and reducing wear and tear.

<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>
