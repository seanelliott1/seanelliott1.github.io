<h2>Water Heater Services Lavonia Georgia</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>

Installing a tankless water heater is a greater upfront investment, but these units can significantly cut the cost of monthly utilities.

Black Pipe Fittings - You may need a few ½ black pipe couplings and elbows to extend or shorten the gas line connecting to the heater. Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular due to the energy savings and consistent flow of hot water. Tankless models cost up to three times as much as a tank water heater, but they more than compensate for it with their unique benefits.</p>

One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater.
