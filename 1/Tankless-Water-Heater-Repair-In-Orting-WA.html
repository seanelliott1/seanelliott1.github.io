Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs. The first kind works similarly to the hot rod in that an electric heating element heats the water.

<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
<p>The easiest way to brace a water heater is to install a pre-approved bracing system, which is available at most hardware stores. If the new tankless system replaced an Energy-Star storage-tank heater (its operating costs are $360 a year), it would take about 25 years to break even.
