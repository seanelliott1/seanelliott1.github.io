Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>
<p>As with many household devices, water heaters become more expensive to maintain as they get older. For this reason, you need a repair expert who is experienced in handling tankless style heaters, and that's exactly what HomeWorks water heater repair technicians can offer you. Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>
