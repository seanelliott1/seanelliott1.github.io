<h2>Water Heater Services Southwick Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If you had installed your storage tank water heater when fuel and electricity were abundant and cheap, then you would have realized that times have truly changed for the worse. Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>If you want your water heater to be replaced with a Mike Diamond Plumbing water heater we are happy to still keep your planned appointment. In any case, when you're planning a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you think that your hot water heater is failing, or you just purchased a home and aren't sure about the condition of your heater, it's important to work with a water heater inspection company to evaluate your system.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Southwick</h3>
<p>In an electric tankless water heater, an electric element heats the water. This type of system uses the same type of panels and liquid system, but instead to transfer solar energy for only the hot water tank, heated fluid flows through a system that can heat up the entire house. Since you are dealing with gas, you will want to ensure that you are using a qualified plumber for this replacement. The cold water is then heated rises up and becomes evenly dispersed throughout the tank.</p>

<p>Electric tankless units can potentially help you save on home energy use and provide continuous hot water on demand. Leaks - If you're finding water around the base of your hot water tank, then your water heater has most likely already corroded beyond the ability for a repair. It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. Some of them have the anode installed in a separate opening on top of the tank and some use a combination anode rod that is installed in the hot water outlet of the tank.</p>
<p>For homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily, demand water heaters can be 24%-34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters.
