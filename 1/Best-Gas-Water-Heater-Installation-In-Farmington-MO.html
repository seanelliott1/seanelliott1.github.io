Traditional heaters often require replacement at the first sign of failure.</p>
<p>If you can't confidently say you know how to install a water heater you really need to use caution. As opposed to waiting for a storage tank to fill with enough hot water for use, tankless water heaters provide a constant supply of it. If you're looking for an energy-efficient option to supply your home with hot water, tankless water heaters are worth serious consideration.

Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
