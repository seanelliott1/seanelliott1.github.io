<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons.

This can add to the your water heater cost. This means that it will take much longer for your water to get hot while you run the faucet waiting for it.

<p>I am sure that at least 50 percent of homes in the U.S. will at some time have to use their homeowners insurance to cover the costs of damages caused by busted water heaters. If this is the case then try to find the place which your pipe or tankless heater is frozen and thaw as soon as possible to prevent the pipe from bursting. The garage (free standing or attached) is one of those not-preferable locations for the water heater installation, but sometimes it is the only one.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
