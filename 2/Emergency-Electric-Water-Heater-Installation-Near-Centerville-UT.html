<p>Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. Even with a tankless a.k.a. instantaneous water heater, you won't have instant hot water whenever you open the kitchen faucet or another outlet. The average energy savings and additional lifespan make tankless heaters a viable option for many homes.

Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
