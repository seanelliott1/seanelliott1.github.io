<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Wayne Indiana</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
