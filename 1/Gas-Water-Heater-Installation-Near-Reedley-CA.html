<p>Water is leaking from the hot water heater tank. However, as long as your water usage at any given time is below the maximum allowable flow rate, tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water. This is often provided by either a flame, on a gas water heater, or a heating element, on an electric water heater. They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>
<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>

<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time. The only way to know if your current hot w. heater is collecting minerals and deposits is to call a qualified plumber and have them come out and inspect your w. heater.</p>

<p>There are several common complaints we hear everyday about Bucks County water heaters. Tankless water heaters are much more energy efficient than tank-based water heaters. Tank-style water heaters may be the most common, but the truth is they're not without flaws. If you have a smaller family, or you're just a couple without kids then we have a unit for you as well in a smaller capacity energy-efficient unit that will keep the hot water coming.</p>
<p>When replacing a storage tank heater, the existing venting is often galvanized sheet metal that can oxidize or rust over a long period of time, if condensation collects inside it. The new tankless models are condensing units that are up to 92 percent more efficient, making their exhaust temperature only about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>
<p>Installation can be more difficult for a tankless water heater, as you may need to upgrade your home's electrical system to support an electric tankless unit, or you may need to run a dedicated gas line to your gas-powered unit. At Heil Plumbing, we have the experience and expertise to recommend the ideal type of water heater for your home or building.
