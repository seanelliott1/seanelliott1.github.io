<p>Sometimes even if you take care of things so much, there will really come a time that you have to change it. But you are faced with the question, when to do it. It is important that you know the best time to change so you can fully maximize its uses. You could go all the way up to almost $5,000 for a whole house gas-powered tankless water heater. This means that you can get a constant stream of hot water when you need it. You do not have to wait for a tank to be filled enough. Tankless water heaters take up less space and are far more convenient than traditional water heaters. They are often referred to as demand or instantaneous water heaters. Well, they're specifically trained in all aspects of a water heater (including electrical wiring, piping, heating elements, anode rods, gas lines, etc.).</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>

<p>High energy bills - An old water heater may be working harder than it needs to and, in turn, raising your energy bills unnecessarily. Might not heat water to high enough temperature in winter, depending on required flow rate of water. To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house” type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
