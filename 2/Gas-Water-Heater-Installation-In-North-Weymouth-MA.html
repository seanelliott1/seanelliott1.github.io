<p>With a standard unit you have to keep reheating the water over and over again, day after day, and year after year but a tankless hot water heater gives you an endless supply and uses about 50% less electricity. In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>

If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>

Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket).
