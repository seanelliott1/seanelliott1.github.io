<h2>Water Heater Services Aurora Colorado</h2>
<p>If it is that time when you are looking to replace your old hot water heater, then it is time to consider changing out to something different. Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired. A Tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>

In the case of installing electric tankless water heaters you may be required to have an electrician upgrade the electrical service to your home or plug, depending on its age and set up. We have a wide variety of gas and electric tank water heaters available in various sizes, all with great warranties and installation.</p>
