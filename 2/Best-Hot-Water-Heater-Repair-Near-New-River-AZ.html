<p>How they work: Tank water heaters typically hold between 20 and 80 gallons of hot water (around 120 degrees Fahrenheit) in a storage tank. If the incoming water pressure is above 150 psi a pressure reducing valve must be installed upstream of the heater. Here are the biggest benefits of installing a tankless water heater in your home.

The new tankless models are condensing units that are up to 92 percent more efficient, making their exhaust temperature only about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>
