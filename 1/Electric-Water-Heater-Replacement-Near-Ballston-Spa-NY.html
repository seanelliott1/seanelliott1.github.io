Whenever removing electric elements on an electric water heater, be sure that the electricity is turned off. Tankless units last about 5-10 years longer than conventional units. Even if you are replacing your water heater with a conventional one, the installation process is not as simple as it might seem.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Ballston Spa New York 12020</h3>
<p>Compact tankless water heaters only heat water when you need it. This type of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water on demand. Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>
<p>Please call us for more details to see if you can get a free estimate on your new water heater. Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age.
