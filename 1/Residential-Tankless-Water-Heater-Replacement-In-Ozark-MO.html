The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>

When you turn on a hot water valve or an appliance that draws hot water such as a washing machine or dishwasher, the gas-fired tankless water heater will draw cold water in through the cold-water inlet pipe on one side.</p>
<p>A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state: In those colder states with a more drastic rise from the temperature of the incoming water to the desired temperature, the tankless water heater is not able to produce as many GPM. So, when it comes to the selection and installation of your new water heater, you should rely on the experts America trusts for water heater services.</p>

The reason that repairs are so important is that they can fix the issue you are currently having with your water heater, as well as make sure lack of repairs doesn't lead to a whole water heater replacement. Tankless heaters are space savers, consisting of a tight arrangement of coils encased in an insulated box about the size of a carry-on suitcase.</p>
