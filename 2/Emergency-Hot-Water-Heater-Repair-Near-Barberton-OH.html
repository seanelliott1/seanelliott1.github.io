Depending on where you live, there may be one or more thermostats to deliver the best comfort; one to control the tubing water supply temperature, one to control different zones throughout the home, and one for outside the home.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>

<p>Since water is only heated when you need it, you save on the costs associated with constantly heating and reheating a large tank of water. How a storage tank water heater works is actually a simple enough process. We are certified in all makes of tankless water heaters and can advise you of your options in completing repairs, performing routine maintenance, and replacing an old unit if needed. Since the system is connected directly to your plumbing and heats water as it passes through your pipes, you will never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained. Our energy saver installation service saves you time and energy.</p>
<p>Some people have certain preferences for what type of heater they buy, but other people have more practical reasons for the choice of what they choose to purchase. With many water pipes hooking to your heater and home's plumbing systems, you could cause more damage than good if you accidentally unscrew the wrong pipe. Even if you aren't sure which type of water heater is best for you, we can evaluate your current plumbing system, hot water usage, and help determine which type of heater you need.</p>
