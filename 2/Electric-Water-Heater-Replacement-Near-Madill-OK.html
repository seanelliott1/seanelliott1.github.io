Instead, why not turn to the new technology that has been around for 50 years - tankless water heaters.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Madill Oklahoma 73446</h3>
<p>A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). Now that you've read up on how to drain your water heater, be sure the gas is turned off at the valve, not just at the control module. VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>If you ever see boiling water coming out of your faucet, or can see steam, you need to turn off your heater immediately and get a professional to inspect it. Boiling water usually means that the thermostat is broken and is overheating. We eliminate the stress and fear of replacing your water heater, by making the repair a fast, friendly, and comfortable experience. This means that the cause is somewhere between the water heater and the fixtures.</p>
<p>Similar to the video directly above, it also shows how to test the thermostat and elements, but it does a particularly good job of showing details such as the exact screws and terminals to test with a multimeter and how to use the multimeter. If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>Not all water heaters can be repaired. The great news is that there are only a few things that can go wrong with water heaters because they have only a few parts. So that increases the installation cost even further. If you flush your tank heater annually and call for professional service when you experience any operational issues, you will ensure your heater the maximum lifespan. High Energy Bills: Your water heater, particularly if you have a traditional tanked unit, is one of the highest consumers of electricity.</p>
