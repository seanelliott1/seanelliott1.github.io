<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Oxford</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>Prices vary depending on the option purchased, but the average price on these heaters is about $500. While you look for a unit, consider the following things: fuel types (gas or electric, unit type (tank or tankless), the length and coverage or warranty, how many people live in your home, long-term maintenance requirements, and operating costs. Our hot water installation services are second to none because we only employ technicians who have been certified to handle the job.</p>

Prices range from about $170 for small gas-fired units to more than $2,000 for high-output heaters that can supply two showers at the same time; $1,000 is about average.</p>
