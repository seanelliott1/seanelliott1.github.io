<h2>Water Heater Services Zeeland Michigan</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>A 2-gallon expansion tank works with water heaters up to 50 gallons. The build-up of excess sediment inside your water tank may cause it to heat a lower volume of H2O. Multiple units can be plumbed in parallel to increase the volume output of hot water. 2. Tankless water heaters deliver hot water faster.

<p>If the heating element burns out, there's no heat to apply to the water. Once this occurs, it is necessary for a replacement to occur and to contact your local plumbing contractor. When sized appropriately, a constant supply of hot water is delivered to your home with ease. But you'll need to deal with pipes, gas lines or electrical. If your repairs are more frequent, it's better to put that money toward a new heater.</p>
<p>The new Federal Water Heater Energy Standards have produced a burst of energy in new water heater design and technology Here's a cool Infographic from the U.S. Department of Energy. Because tankless water heaters are a compact size, they don't take up a lot of space. They save energy (and save you money), they provide unlimited hot water, they're small and compact, they never leak and don't contribute to harmful metals in your water.</p>
<p>Because of their size, tankless heaters can be installed in small rooms, apartments, and any other spaces which wouldn't typically allow a tank water heater.

A tankless water heater will save you money since it provides instant heating when hot water is needed rather than constantly heating and reheating the same water until it is used.

Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>

Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
