<h2>Water Heater Services Gretna Louisiana</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

<p>2. Electrical tankless water heaters can require upgraded electrical service of much higher amperage than you currently have. When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>

Water heaters are an integral part of the plumbing systems in residential homes and commercial buildings. Heaters are used for not only space heating, but cooking, cleaning, and showering as well. Considering the benefit of a warranty replacement when the water heater is 4-5 years old with a 6 yr. warranty, the customer should really consider if this is a wise choice or if at that point, they should simply purchase a new water heater and obtain the full warranty protection of the new water heater.</p>
