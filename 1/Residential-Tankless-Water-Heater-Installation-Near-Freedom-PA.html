<h2>Water Heater Services Freedom Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>When it comes to do it yourself projects around the house, you can save a bundle of money over having someone else do the work for you. Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank. Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life. Payback time was longer for a tankless unit that replaced an existing storage tank but more reasonable with new construction.</p>

<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Replacement Freedom</h3>
<p>If the water coming out of your faucets is way too hot or it steams, it's possible that the water heater isn't shutting off at the temperature it's supposed to. This is probably because the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is malfunctioning. The most common complaint regarding a water heater is that it doesn't produce enough hot water. Our factory trained technicians provide 24 hour emergency service on all makes and models, and same day replacement with no charge for removal and disposal of your old water heater.</p>

And no one wants to pay for an exorbitant electric bill for hot water never used.

A tankless water heater in a bathroom is a popular option amongst today's homeowners.</p>
<p>However, they can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30 percent, by only heating water when it is needed rather than keeping a tank of hot water constantly heated. This is known as standby energy loss and it's costing you money. Tankless water heaters, also known as "on demand" heaters, heat water without a storage tank, using energy only when needed - rather than maintaining a tank of hot water. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water every day, according to They also last about twice as long as a tank water heater.</p>

We specialize in tankless water heater replacement and new installations. If accessible, remove the cover plate from a gas heater tank. A tankless heats the water quickly, as it is needed. Here are two helpful videos that show how to troubleshoot an electric water heater that has no hot water.</p>
<p>Purchase prices are closely tied to warranties, and longer warrantied water heaters tend to be better built and better insulated. Depending on the unit, a gas line may need to be run to the installation point, or you may need an electrician to upgrade a panel or wire the unit into place. Water Leaks: Water leaks at the base of your water heater tank are something that needs to be addressed right away. Instead, each efficient Rinnai tankless water heater is only the size of a small suitcase.</p>
<p>In part that's because removing a large tank takes more time and effort than removing the much smaller tankless units.

Once the old heater is done draining disconnect the gas pipe at the union fitting.</p>
<p>Your water heater's heating elements and thermostat can also wear out, leaving you with a fluctuating temperature or no hot water at all. Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility. Wait a little while, then check the water temperature at a faucet.</p>
