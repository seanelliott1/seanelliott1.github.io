A common misconception is that a water heater which has stopped functioning has to be replaced. With these units, you don't have to ever worry about a rusted tank that leaks. The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed. Many people choose to simply use the same type that they are using presently, while others are influenced by the purchase price, the cost of running the heater over time, how energy efficient they are and how long it takes for the water to heat.</p>

A malfunctioning water heater is inconvenient and potentially expensive if you need to replace the unit. The main perk of gas tankless water heaters is that they will often be able to provide you with a higher flow rate than electric units.</p>
<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Northridge CA</h3>
<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended. Depending on where you live, there may be one or more thermostats to deliver the best comfort; one to control the tubing water supply temperature, one to control different zones throughout the home, and one for outside the home.</p>

Best performance comes from gas units, as electric units are not Energy Star-rated. Many homeowners in our area are choosing to switch to a tankless water heater for many reasons.

While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>It is important when planning for your new water heater installation in Houston to call Nick's Plumbing and Sewer Services to hire a plumbing company that can handle your water heater installation from start to finish.
