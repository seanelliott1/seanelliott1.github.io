The Rheem® Combination Boiler joins the benefits of a tankless water heater with those of a hydronic boiler—all in one one space-saving unit. While a typical water heater doesn't take up that much room, the additional space can be used for storage or other purposes. Metals inside your water heater can rust with time and can be a cause of rusty water flow.</p>
<p>These are all symptoms of a failing water tank, and if you catch them early enough, you can avoid total failure by calling a hot water maintenance company for help. We suggest reading up on our Advantage Program to potentially avoid problems with your water heater. Keep in mind, however, that as a trusted water heater contractor, our most important goal when working on your project is to do it correctly, instead of quickly.</p>
<p>When installing an exterior model you need to insulate the pipelines. A direct vent water heater is basically a sealed unit that has either two pipes or a concentric pipe pipe within pipe to suck in fresh air from outside the bathroom and also dispense exhaust gases outside. Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
