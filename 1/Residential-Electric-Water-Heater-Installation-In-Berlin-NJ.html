<h2>Water Heater Services Berlin New Jersey</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly. Rust: Anytime there's rust on the outside of your tank, around fittings, or in the water itself, you're water heater may be on its last legs. Solar power water heater systems use the sun's energy to generate warm water for your home. The compact designs of this kind of heater leaves space for a water softener or additional storage such as "use it as you need it".</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
<p>For instance, for a home with two stories and a basement, the worst place to install the heater is in the basement. However if you find that you have no hot water with an electric tank it would be a good idea to check your breaker to see if the breaker has tripped. A broken or deteriorated dip tube can cause the cold water to stay near the top, making your water heater unable to heat the water properly. There are a lot of reasons why a homeowner or business owner might choose to upgrade to a new water heater, with some of them ranging from the size to the water heater's ability to heat up water.</p>
