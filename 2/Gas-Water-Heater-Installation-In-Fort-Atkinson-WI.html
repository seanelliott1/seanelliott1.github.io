<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Atkinson Wisconsin</h2>
<p>A plumbing problem isn't always an if emergency , but when it is, wouldn't you like to be protected? The first two problems are easy to rectify and do not necessarily indicate any need for heater replacement. Installing an eligible solar or electric heat pump water heater entitles you to STCs, which can be sold to registered agents or traded individually.

Solar water heaters: These water heaters use the power of the sun to heat water. Just call us and ask us, Please fix my water heater problems!” and we'll be there soon to get your hot water running normally again.</p>

Electric water heater: Turn off the circuit breaker on the water heater's circuit at the home's breaker box. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>You'll also save in repair and maintenance costs, as well, because tankless units tend to have fewer problems like leaks. If water comes out of the faucet with a brown, yellow, or red tint, there could be rust occurring inside your water heater tank or the pipes in your home.

Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>

<p>Typically, you'll have a choice between gas, electric, tankless, and even solar-powered water heaters. Since the tank is the only part of the system that can actually force you to replace the water heater, be sure to troubleshoot before you buy a new unit. There is also a range of fuel sources that can heat water such as solar, gas, electricity and wood. Also known as instantaneous water heater, the heater heats the water on demand.</p>
<p>Hybrid: These heaters are the new energy-efficient heaters that operate similar to a heat pump that you may have heating your home. We offer a water heater that can meet your needs.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>In your specific case, this may require a larger gas line or a much larger electric supply than what is currently running to your water heater location. Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service. If you're not getting hot water, it could be the heating element or another maintenance issue. Whether you have a gas, propane, or electric water heater, there might be times when you wish you had more hot water to work with.</p>
<p>Now that know how to calculate the size tankless heater to fit your home what's left is to determine whether electric or natural gas is the best energy source. Your water heater may be old and inefficient, it may need repairing, or you may need a larger water heater or tankless model. We depend on our water heaters a lot-they provide us with water to cook, clean, bathe, and wash dishes with. Electric fired tankless water heaters have scald guard thermostats.</p>
<p>At Carter's Plumbing, we carry only the most efficient water heaters for your home or business. The most effective means to size a tankless water heater for any realistic application is to approximate the peak rate of flow that will need to be provided by the water heater at any given time. There might be an issue with your water heater. Our team provides prompt and professional customer service and 24-hour emergency repairs.</p>
