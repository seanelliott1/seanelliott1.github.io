Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
