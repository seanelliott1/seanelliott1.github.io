<h2>Water Heater Services Waynesboro Virginia</h2>
<p>A plumbing problem isn't always an if emergency , but when it is, wouldn't you like to be protected? The first two problems are easy to rectify and do not necessarily indicate any need for heater replacement. Installing an eligible solar or electric heat pump water heater entitles you to STCs, which can be sold to registered agents or traded individually. If it's a gas water heater use your two pipe wrenches and disconnect the union, that is between the supply pipe and the inlet pipe or it might be a flared fitting.</p>
<p>If you have a warranty of 12 to 15 years, which is typical, it doesn't make financial sense to replace a tank water heater with a tankless,” says Banta. Often an emergency, like a leaking water tank, is the reason a water heater is replaced. The Service Company Plumbing & Drains team is experienced in handling all types of water heater repair or replacement issues and can often have your hot water heater repaired or a new water heater installation completed same day in most cases.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment. If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional. Gas units are often a little higher costs for installation because of the venting required. If the water starts out in the middle of the heater for instance, it will leave the heater after only being in the pipe for half the time it would need to reach full temperature.</p>

<p>Luckily, some tankless models are designed so that a circulation system can be added without reconfiguring piping or adding an additional buffer tank. You probably already know that your hot water heater is an extremely important appliance in your home or business.

Upgrading to an energy efficient water heater will save a great deal of money over the life of the unit.</p>
<p>In addition to reliable water heater services, we also provide customers with exceptional customer service.

Improperly installed gas lines can leak, creating an explosion risk. Make sure the power is connected to the heater, then reset the thermostat.</p>
<p>Tankless can also be a good choice for large families because you have more people consistently using more hot water. There are many reasons why these are much better than the tank heaters, but let's consider the most important reasons to switch over, money. If your water heater has rust-colored water or if your water heater leaks , let us know. The initial cost of a combination or integrated water and space heating system is going to cost you more than if you install a separate heater and furnace or boiler, but both installation and maintenance costs are probably going to be less.</p>

<p>Gas water heater: Connect the gas line to the gas burner control valve. A conventional gas water heater is a tried-and-tested system designed to keep your home's hot water running. You can control the output temperature directly on the tankless water heater, so you know how hot the water is delivered to your taps will be. Tankless heaters have become popular due to their many benefits. They both use an insulated storage tank jacket made of steel, with insulation between the storage tank and the tank jacket to reduce heat loss of the heated water.</p>
