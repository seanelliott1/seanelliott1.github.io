<h2>Water Heater Services Gulfport Mississippi</h2>
<p>A tankless gas hot water heater can be complicated when it comes to piping and venting requirements. In addition, many state and local utilities offer rebates and incentives for converting to energy-saving appliances, which can help mitigate the cost of installing a tankless system. The payoff is big — you'll save up to 60% of the water heater part of your electric bill. If your water heater needs to be repaired periodically, then a decision to replace it needs to be taken. When the water on the top of the tank is hot, the top element turns off and the lower one heats.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>Modern water heaters are also more efficient so a new water heater installation will also save you money on your energy bill. When you want help navigating the often confusing waters (no pun intended) of making the best choice of water heater for your home, you'll be pleased you contacted the professionals at Petro Home Services today.

<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
