Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>Purchase prices are closely tied to warranties, and longer warrantied water heaters tend to be better built and better insulated.
