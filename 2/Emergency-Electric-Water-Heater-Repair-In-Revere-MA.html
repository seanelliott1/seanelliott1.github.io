<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>These units can heat between 20 to 100 gallons of water. With this type of water heater, a huge amount of hot water can heated as needed instead of storing it in a tank. As such, rather than limiting your business's capabilities to the capacities of your storage tanks, a tankless water heater provides you with an infinite supply of hot water. But if the heater is already too old, and leakage is impossible to repair, then this will definitely mean replacement.</p>
