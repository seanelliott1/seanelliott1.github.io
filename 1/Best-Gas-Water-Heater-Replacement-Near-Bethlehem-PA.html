<h2>Water Heater Services Bethlehem Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>When the hot water is being taken from a tank, the tank will be filled up with cold water, which will cool the temperature of the water that is available. The water heater tank is damaged or rusted. One of the most vital plumbing components in your home is the water heater.

<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>The difference between the two is how the water is heated, via electrical resistance coils or natural gas. These kinds of tankless gas water heaters, like the Bosch 2400EO-NG natural gas outdoor water heater, helps eliminate the need for vents. Some of these issues can be addressed by installing a tankless water heater. For expert water heater repair in the Orange County area, look to your neighbors at Barker and Sons Plumbing & Rooter.</p>
