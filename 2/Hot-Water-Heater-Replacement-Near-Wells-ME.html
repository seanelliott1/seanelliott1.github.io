By contrast, installing a conventional electric water heater is within your reach… Provided that you possess some experience in plumbing and electricity. Because the tankless water heater is going to only give the hot water as it is needed instead of having it sit in the tank all the time waiting for you to use it.

Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
