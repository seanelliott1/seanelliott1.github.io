<h2>Water Heater Services Warrenton Virginia</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
<p>Whether you repair or replace, water heaters will perform better and last longer if you flush the tank once a year to remove sediment. If you are not 100% confident installing an electric water heater, Lowe's recommends that you hire a professional. Gas units are often a little higher costs for installation because of the venting required. If the water starts out in the middle of the heater for instance, it will leave the heater after only being in the pipe for half the time it would need to reach full temperature.</p>

Tank water heaters have an even lower efficiency rating. Scorching Hot Water: When a water heater thermostat is broken, the result can be water that is way too hot and thus unbearable to enjoy. Use teflon tape on the connecting portion of the valve if it doesn't quite fit into the heater.</p>
<p>Keep your water heater set to 120 degrees F as higher temperatures can increase sediment buildup in the tank. The next thing that you should consider if you are asking the question of when do you need a new water heater is the age of the system that you have in your home.

Here at The Hot Water Company, we are taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and can actually serve our great customers without coming in contact with them at all, as most water heaters are located outside or in the garage.</p>
<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>On-demand water heaters don't require repairs as often as conventional water heaters, but they do need regular service. Tankless water heaters are sized according to its maximum temperature rise possible at a given flow rate. The two pipes coming out of the top of every water heater tank are the supply and delivery pipes ; one is the cold-water inlet pipe and the other is the hot-water outlet pipe The cold-water inlet pipe carries cold water from your home's water supply into the tank where it comes out of the dip tube , filling the tank with water to be heated.</p>
