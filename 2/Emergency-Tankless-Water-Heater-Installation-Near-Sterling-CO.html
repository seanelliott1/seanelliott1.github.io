<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Replacement Sterling</h3>
<p>If the water coming out of your faucets is way too hot or it steams, it's possible that the water heater isn't shutting off at the temperature it's supposed to. This is probably because the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is malfunctioning. The most common complaint regarding a water heater is that it doesn't produce enough hot water. Our factory trained technicians provide 24 hour emergency service on all makes and models, and same day replacement with no charge for removal and disposal of your old water heater.</p>

Water heater problems are a good example of when this choice is important. Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>

Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers" are the most common water heaters installed for the last 120 years or so and are used for central heating and can also heat the water for your home using steam.</p>
