Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes.

<p>8. A good indicator for both electric and gas heaters is the sacrificial anode rod. Your water heater is under constant stress to deliver enough hot water for your family. There are some less common causes that can make your electric water heater not as effective or efficient as it used to be.
