<h2>Water Heater Services Chambersburg Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to hire a plumber for a water heater installation. Before you call the professionals, you can troubleshoot your malfunctioning hot water dispenser on your own. We take care of all your tankless water heater repair and installation services. We have provided outstanding plumbing services since 1980 and have plenty of experience with all types of water heaters. To remove the old water heater, shut off the valves on the two water lines (one inlet and one outlet) leading into the existing water heater.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>Instead, when a flow-activated switch comes on, the heat exchanger turns on and heats the water as you need it. Tankless water heaters come in point-of-use styles like a coffee pot plumbed into the water system, or as whole-house units. Call (805) 499-0448 today to begin your expert AC repair, installation, or replacement. Tank style water heaters generally last about ten years. If your energy bills are rising, a new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them back down.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Replacement Chambersburg</h3>
<p>Directly connected to the water heater (no shut-off valve nor pressure reducer), it balances out the pressure inside the appliance. New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
<p>For example, an electric heat pump water heater typically is more energy efficient than an electric conventional storage water heater. When you call Covenant Plumbing, we will help you decide if it's time to replace your water heater and guide you to a water heater replacement that is best for the needs of your home.
