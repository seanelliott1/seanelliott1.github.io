<h2>Water Heater Services Triangle Virginia</h2>
<p>When it's time to replace your old water heater, you'll want it done fast and at a fair price. Gas hot water heater installation (hot water heater system replacement) is NOT a DIY (do-it-yourself) project. There is no need to wait until your hot water heater breaks down or becomes inefficient.

If you're relatively inexperienced, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills.</p>
<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money.

Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>
