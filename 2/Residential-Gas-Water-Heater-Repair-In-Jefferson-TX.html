We sell a complete line of gas and electric hot water heaters from top manufacturers like Rheem, Bradford White, Bosch, State, Reliance, Noritz and A. Smith. Be sure to let us know if you plan on installing a hot tub, spa, or jacuzzi in the future.

<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>

In any case, when you're planning a water heater replacement, play it safe.

<p>Even though the energy cost savings of installing a tankless wanter heater are attractive, your savings can be offset by the upfront costs of one, which are far greater than a traditional system. Hot water is an essential element of modern life. With Chattanooga Water Heater Co., you can expect service from experienced and knowledgeable professionals.

<p>Natural gas units are the least expensive choice and are powered from a city utility supply which costs an average of $200 per year. Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates. And keep in mind that because of recent federal energy regulations, a replacement storage tank may take up more space than your old one, even if it's the same capacity, because newer ones are required to have more insulation.</p>

<p>An expansion tank is a safety system for water that expands when it heats up. Most have a little room inside for expansion. A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside. You will definitely want to have an expert take care of the installation if this is the first time a natural gas water heater is going to be installed in your house, as this will ensure that there is a large enough gap between the interior walls and the tank to prevent any possibility of fire.</p>

If your unit is no longer able to produce hot water, is visibly leaking, or is making strange noises, it is crucial you have an experienced and professionally trained Fredericksburg plumber take a look as soon as possible.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Jefferson Texas 75657</h3>
<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>When possible, we will always recommend cost-effective repairs that can extend the life of your water heater. We have many ENERGY STAR®-rated water heaters to choose from and we are professionals at water heater installation. Tankless water heaters can reduce hot water energy costs by roughly 30% on average.

<p>A tankless water heater can place a virtually unlimited supply of hot water within your reach 24 hours a day while saving you time, energy, money, and space. First of all, it is important to understand the basic operation of a tankless water heater. New storage tank water heaters are required to operate more efficiently, and tankless (on-demand) water heaters are even more efficient than that. This indicates what sort of energy source is used to heat the water.</p>
<p>Conventional: A traditional water heater has a storage tank and either gas burners or electric heating elements. Because installation varies by location and by the type of heater, the following steps merely show the general process and may or may not apply to your situation. No matter when you discover a water heater problem, you can trust Axberg to repair it. There are visible symptoms that you'll notice if your water heater needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
