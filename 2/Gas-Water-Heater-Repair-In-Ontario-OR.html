<h2>Water Heater Services Ontario Oregon</h2>
<p>It is an option to install your own electric tankless water heater. This price estimate includes the cost of a basic tank water heater, installation, materials, removal of the old unit, and the cost of any permits. These use a heat pump to pull heat from the surrounding air and transfer it to the water in the tank via a compressor and coils. TML Service Experts can help you conserve hot water and decrease water heating costs with ENERGY STAR-rated models, installing low-flow fixtures and suggesting other energy-efficiency upgrades.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>
