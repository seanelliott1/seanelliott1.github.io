The difference is the burners apply heat to water moving through the tankless system, rather than to a standing water supply, and the burners only come on when there's a demand for water.</p>

To help you make the right decision about which kind to install, we'll explain how tankless water heaters work and point out some of their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

Available throughout the United States to those who will have or already have a geothermal heat pump system installed in their homes for space heating and cooling. You appear to be a good candidate for a heat pump water heater.</p>

If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater. Installing a tankless hot water heater while a new home is under construction makes good sense, especially for gas units that require more to make them operational.</p>

One safety features that a Paloma digital tankless heater has is protection against fire.

Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
