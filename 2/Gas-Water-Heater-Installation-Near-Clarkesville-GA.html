<h2>Water Heater Services Clarkesville Georgia</h2>
<p>How much will a new hot water heater cost you? The designs have one principle heat source shared between two other pieces of equipment, a tank water heater and an air handler and these make up a space heating water heater system. Flow rate is the amount of water that a tankless unit can heat at a given time. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use. Caccia, the third-generation plumber, says that once you make the switch, labor costs are less for replacing an old tankless water heater with a new one than for replacing an old storage tank with a new one.</p>
<p>Whenever you are ready to move forward with your tankless water heater project, your plumber or licensed installation professional should be well versed in the current status of rebates available and add that information to his recommendations. We carry out full-service water heater solutions, including repair, installation, and replacement. It may take a few hours before your water heater if fully heated. This typically requires a larger diameter gas line for gas units or a higher voltage power supply for electric ones.</p>

In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat. Tankless gas models need to produce very high combustion temperatures so that they can instantaneously raise the temperature of incoming cold water to the desired temperature.</p>

<p>Energy Savings: Because these units only heat water when it's needed, you can save big on energy costs. Water heaters are essentially steel tanks with vitreous glass bonded to the inside to protect the steel from rust.

First and foremost, there is the issue of safety. Take a look at your current gas heater and notice the vent hood which is slightly above the top of the heater. The longer lifetime of tankless models means homeowners incur less expense repairing and replacing the water heater.</p>
