<h2>Water Heater Services Spencer Indiana</h2>
<p>A hot water heater problem poses a lot of stress to households in cold areas. Replacing the dip tube also requires removing the cold water pipe, and changing out the heating element requires dealing with 220 volt electricity, so if you're not experienced with plumbing and electrical work, it may be best to leave these jobs to your local master plumber In addition, any repair work needed for gas heaters is best left to a skilled technician in order to avoid the risk of fire, gas leaks, or personal injury.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work.

Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>

<p>I spoke with a technician who has seen tankless water heaters fail due to hard water deposits in as little as two years here in Minnesota.

<p>Get your water heater flushed out regularly to keep it running well. The only greater percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless units only operate when you need hot water, thereby reducing energy consumption and costs by up to 35%. This gets to one of my colleague's concerns: how long it takes for a tankless water heater to deliver hot water to its final destination. Upgrading to an energy efficient water heater will save a great deal of money over the life of the unit.</p>
<p>The average cost for a plumber to install a water heater is about $80 per hour.

Not only are they highly efficient, but they can also save you money by heating water only on-demand. Used for decades in Europe where living space is at a premium, tankless water heaters are a safe and reliable way to use less energy. What can go wrong: A single tankless heater may not have sufficient capacity to supply hot water to multiple locations at the same time.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters.
