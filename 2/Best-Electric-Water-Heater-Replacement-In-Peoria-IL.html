Click the links below to learn about tankless water heaters. If you're like most homeowners, you rarely service your water heater. Tankless hot water heaters are a completely different breed. A flow sensor (2) detects water coming into the heater and sends a signal to the control panel to start producing hot water.</p>

Once repaired, you may want to consider a maintenance plan on your hot water heater to make sure that you do not have future issues. Because of the demands of larger households, it might make sense to install one or more additional tankless units. The computer pulls in gas and ignites a fire within the contained burner, which provides heat to the heat exchanger The incoming water is then circulated through the activated heat exchanger, heating the water to the temperature set on the thermostat before leaving the system through the hot water outlet pipe where it is directed to the appropriate faucet or appliance.</p>
<p>Instead you'll have to remove the metal thermostat cover on the side of the water heater, pull out the insulation and hold the tester near the wires leading into the top of the high-temperature cutoff switch (see Figure A). Tankless units take about 15 seconds to bring water up to temperature, but you still have to wait for that hot water to arrive at your shower head or faucet, just as you do with a tank-type heater.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Peoria Illinois 61604</h3>
<p>I refuse to repair an improperly installed unit as do most plumbers I know. PSE&G's WorryFree Replacement Service does include the replacement of water heaters. Choosing a tankless unit with the correct flow rate for your hot water needs can be confusing. There are many service calls in which we receive for recently installed hot water heating equipment that is not working as expected. Temperature adjustments: If your water is too hot or not hot enough, the thermostat on the unit may need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>An hour later the tank less water heater failed again. You can see these valves beside or above the heater.

Your tankless water heater can provide you with endless hot water for years to come with the right repair and maintenance from Central Plumbing. What this example shows us, though, is that the upfront costs of a whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly 2 to 2.5 times more expensive than a high-efficiency gas storage water heater and a high-efficiency is less expensive to own than a conventional gas storage water heater.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
