If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>

<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy.

This water heater hangs on your wall and, instead of storing a large tank of water that is kept constantly hot-even when you're asleep or not at home-the tankless water heater produces hot water only when it's needed, as it's needed.</p>
<p>They work like this: A tankless coil water heater has a heat exchanger or heating coil installed in a home's boiler or main furnace. With tankless heaters you have the benefit of an endless supply of hot water. A tankless water heater is less likely to corrode than a storage tank system, but if the pipes start to leak, corrosion can start up. If the corrosion develops too far, the whole system may need to be replaced.</p>
<p>This can save you a great deal of valuable storage room compared to other models of water heaters that are available. Installing tankless water heater will hardly take our plumbers much time. People with electric hot water heaters will see a greater cost reduction than those with natural gas heaters, but everyone will save money over time.
