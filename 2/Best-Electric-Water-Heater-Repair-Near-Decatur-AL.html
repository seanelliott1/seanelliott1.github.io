<p>The recommended water heater setting of about 115-120 degrees, it keeps your water heater from overheating and save a lot of electricity. Trying to install a water heater yourself can be dangerous and end up costing more than hiring a professional. All forms of flammable material must be kept far away from the heater, while construction components hidden in the wall like wooden supports must be properly insulated from heat in order not to weaken or even ignite as the heater is used over time.</p>

<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down. But as time passes by and your water heater is slowly decaying, you can expect its relief valve to lose its function. Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>
<p>Conventional hot water heaters keep water in storage tanks at a set temperature and distribute hot water on an as-needed basis. Replace your standard water heater with an electric fired tankless water heater. Normally, gas-type water heater last up to 12 years. Hot water temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit can cause serious burns.
