Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank. Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life.

<p>It only heats water when you are calling for hot water and heats only in the amount that you need.

Roto-Rooter plumbers are experts at water heater leak repair. However, if you're looking to make your home more energy efficient, our technicians may recommend replacing a less-efficient unit with one that heats better and uses less energy.</p>
<p>For instance, sediment has the tendency to build up at the bottom of the tank over time, which can decrease the efficiency — and the life — of the tank, and even go as far as clogging up water lines.

<p>Tankless can also be a good choice for large families because you have more people consistently using more hot water. There are many reasons why these are much better than the tank heaters, but let's consider the most important reasons to switch over, money. If your water heater has rust-colored water or if your water heater leaks , let us know.

<p>Then, you will have the choice to proceed with the repairs, decline the repairs, or replace your water heater completely. In gas water heaters, when hot water stops coming out altogether, the first thing to check is the pilot light. If you are ready to enjoy the benefits of a tankless unit, call us at (847) 855-0075 for an immediate installation. Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>Water consumption (amount of hot water to be used) is another important factor in determining which heating system to purchase. Denver water is quite cold, which creates condensation on the walls of hot water storage tanks. Electric water heaters use, you guessed it- electricity, to heat the water. In fact, according to the National Association of Realtors , energy efficient upgrades such as tankless water heaters are among the top things that buyers are looking for in a home today.</p>
<p>When a hot water tap is turned on, cold water travels through a coil pipe into the unit. Homeowners with on-demand (tankless) water heaters that use less than 41 gallons or less of hot water each day, enjoy between 24 and 34 percent more energy efficiency than storage tank water heaters. Give us a call today at 843-873-6331 to set an appointment to have your water heater system upgraded. While heating a room is the most common application, it is also used to heat water, swimming pools, spas, sidewalks, driveways and garages.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
