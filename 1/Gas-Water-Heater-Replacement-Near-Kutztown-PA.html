<h2>Water Heater Services Kutztown Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we imagine doing things very easy. The most important component in the tankless water heater is the heat exchanger; this component requires periodic flushing. If we believe that we can repair your hot water heater, we'll complete repairs on the spot. Whether you live in a historic house with vintage pipes or a brand new home with state-of-the-art systems, Lakewood Plumbing & Heating can handle any plumbing challenge.

If you feel warmth, your water heater is probably working. If your heater is electric or gas, we will talk you through our tankless water heater installation. Consumer Reports recently tested several electric and gas whole-house tankless water heaters from brands such as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless.</p>
<p>Apply heat-resistant silicone sealant to the vent shaft of the water heater, slip on a connector and secure with a hose clamp. Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants. Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>

If you're noticing your system is struggling to operate, hot water heater repair is needed. If you are sure you have gas, and replacing the thermocouple doesn't fix the problem, the gas control valve is about the only thing left to check. Tempering valve regulations that now require hot water tempering valves, to protect against scalding.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>

Homeowners who are asking themselves are tankless water heaters worth it will find that the answer depends on where they live, the prices for installation in their area, and the way in which their household uses hot water. When we think of water heater temperature problems, our minds usually jump to the scenario of having no hot water.</p>

<p>Therefore, if water is leaking directly from the tank, it's time to replace your water heater. A tankless heater can supply no more than its flow rate, typically 2 to 5 gallons per minute. Having been the industry standard for home hot water, you're likely quite familiar with a tank water heater. Unlike conventional water heaters, there is no backup hot water source during these emergency situations. In addition to removing the old unit and disposing of it safely, Roto-Rooter's water heater experts can ensure that gas, electrical, and other connections are handled safely and the water heater is installed properly.</p>

Electric water heaters typically last a year or two longer than gas models, but not always. They also tend to have many fewer problems with them than other types of water heating systems. If you need your water heater replaced, we're up for the task.</p>
<p>When replacing a storage tank heater, the existing venting is often galvanized sheet metal that can oxidize or rust over a long period of time, if condensation collects inside it. The new tankless models are condensing units that are up to 92 percent more efficient, making their exhaust temperature only about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>
<p>Next, your installer will mount the actual heating unit. For most households, the ideal hot water temperature is between 120 and 140 degrees. Instead of fighting over who gets the first shower in the morning, you don't have to worry about that with a new water heater. When you turn the hot water tap off the heat exchanger shuts down, saving energy and money. B&B Heating & Cooling are Homer Glen's tankless water heater specialists.</p>
