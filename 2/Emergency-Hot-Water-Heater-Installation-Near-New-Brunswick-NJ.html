<p>Once that hot water is gone, you will have to wait for a new 30 or 50 gallon tank to be heated again in order to have hot water.

This cuts down on the wait time for hot water, provides you with a limitless supply, and allows for the whole family to gain access to hot water without waiting for your tank to refill. A typical tankless water heater installation can take a crew of 2 technicians an average of 6-10 hours, depending on installation requirements.</p>

Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>As such, this is the main reason you should focus on upgrading your water heater, as the old one is woefully out of date. Rheem Tankless  Water Heaters offer the savings, comfort and protection  you need.

New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
