However, if your tankless water heater frequently becomes overloaded, you should consider either upgrading to a tankless water heater with a higher capacity or adding a second unit. Electric: Electric water heaters use your home's electricity to heat water. Replacing electric water heaters is an arduous task.</p>

Water heater problems are a good example of when this choice is important. Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>

Tankless heaters are space savers, consisting of a tight arrangement of coils encased in an insulated box about the size of a carry-on suitcase.</p>
<p>A gas water heater can be used even during power outages, and are usually more ideal for a large family, as they have a fast recovery time. While these are cost-efficient at first buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable way for you to receive hot water, especially if your unit is outdated. One of the most important ways to maintain the functionality of a tank-type water heater is to flush the tank.
