<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help.
