<h2>Water Heater Services Canton Michigan</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
<p>And obviously, tankless water heaters take up much less space than the hulking behemoth of an old fashioned storage water heater. Our water heater repair will fix problems with any make and type of burners and other heating parts. Request us today for a free estimate on installing a new unit. Environmentally Friendly: Improved efficiency also leads to a reduced carbon footprint, making a tankless water heater installation a great move to make your home greener.</p>
