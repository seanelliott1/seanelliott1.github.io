<p>It can be complicated removing old water heaters because they can weigh over 150 pounds and can release scalding-hot water if handled improperly. Hot water heaters are available in different models that are powered by solar energy, gas and electricity. Water leaks usually are caused by leaking valves and plumbing connections, but they can also be related to tank problems. This model of heater can serve a practically unlimited source of hot water, because it's constantly heating a big amount of water.</p>

Energy efficiency - You'll want your new unit to maximize energy efficiency while keeping your energy costs at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
