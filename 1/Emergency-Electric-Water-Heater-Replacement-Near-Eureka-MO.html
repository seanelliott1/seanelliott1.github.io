Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>

With routine maintenance, you can avoid having to repair your water heater, and it will last much longer.

Over time, the heating element may wear out.

This heat from the pilot flame causes a tiny electrical signal to be sent to the control valve, telling the control valve that there is a flame present so it's OK to let the gas through to the main burner when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>
<p>T&P Valve usually comes with the new heaters. The tankless water heater is going to end up saving you money if you choose to have one in place in your home or business. However, if there is sufficient pressure and the run length is short enough, it is possible to use a ½-inch line, which is used by most existing storage tank-type water heaters.

<p>So in a larger unit with multiple residents—or several units sharing a water heater—it can be tricky to get enough hot water for everyone to shower at the same time, or to do laundry and run the dishwasher at the same time. They are also ideal for families who have small homes and little room for bulky water heaters. Continuous Supply of Hot Water: You never have to worry about running out of hot water, so this option is perfect for homeowners with family members who take long steamy showers.</p>
<p>If the supply lines (gas and water) need to be moved that is the first major issue, then you have to think about the other details: replacing the exhaust pipe, a new concrete slab, a metal shed, earthquake straps, exhaust straps, and not to mention any flooring, ceiling and roofing repairs along with some hefty patchwork. Then your hot water tank is suddenly on the forefront of your mind. At Heil Plumbing, we constantly update our products to give homeowners and builders efficient water heater systems.</p>
