<h2>Water Heater Services Collinsville Virginia</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>Water heater failure can happen anytime and may lead to your tank fully discharging, potential damage and temporary loss of service. Specialists from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning will help you reach your goals when it comes to water heating systems. The tankless water heaters also cause an increase in water wastage since you have to let the water run longer to get your hot water. Before finalizing everything, make sure that you do enough comparison with the existing heaters that are out in the market.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life. A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve.

<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>If your water heater is approaching the ten-year mark, it's time to start considering replacement services. For commercial facilities including hotels, universities, and restaurant chains, problems with a hot water heater can have a huge impact on daily operations and must be avoided whenever possible.

<p>The following guide explains how to install an electric tankless water heater step by step. These units heat faster and are more economical than standard electric models. Simply go to your water heater, check the temperature dial, and make sure it is set in between 115 to 120 degrees F (or 46 degrees to 49 degrees C). Lowering the setting will prevent the tank from overheating, which reduces energy bills drastically.</p>

<p>Once that hot water is gone, you will have to wait for a new 30 or 50 gallon tank to be heated again in order to have hot water. Tankless units supply a steady stream of hot water with no waiting and no running short. This cuts down on the wait time for hot water, provides you with a limitless supply, and allows for the whole family to gain access to hot water without waiting for your tank to refill. A typical tankless water heater installation can take a crew of 2 technicians an average of 6-10 hours, depending on installation requirements.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>

Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
