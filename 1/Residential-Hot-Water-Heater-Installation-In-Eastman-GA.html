<h2>Water Heater Services Eastman Georgia</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>Gas hot water system installation cost is typically between $250 and $700 to replace an old hot water system with the same type in the same spot. With a tankless water heater, there is no tank to heat up, so the supply of hot water is endless. Enjoy reliable hot water with expert water heater repair and installation services from Marc Francis Plumbing, your plumbing pros in the Tri-Cities. Before looking for Cumming water heater repair services, it can be useful to have a general idea of what might be the underlying problem so you know what to expect.</p>
<p>This helps ensure that your new hot water heater is installed properly and will provide you and your residents and employees with years of hot water. Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>
