<p>Tankless water heaters remove the need for a bulky water tank. Paloma tankless has a variety of heater which you could chose form either it is for your house, or for commercial use. Setting the top thermostat higher will not cause the top element to turn on if the water temperature in the top of the tank is already higher than the highest setting of the thermostat.

Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
