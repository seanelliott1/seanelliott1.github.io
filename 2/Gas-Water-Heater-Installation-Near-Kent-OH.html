<h2>Water Heater Services Kent Ohio</h2>
<p>Various devices at home allow us to live and move comfortably. It also means that you should never run out” of hot water, because it is continually heated for as long as you leave hot water running. Electric tankless water heaters are quickly growing in popularity given their potential energy savings and ability to deliver hot water on demand. Interior tankless heaters need to bring in air from the outside, and there are two different methods to accomplish this: power vent and direct vent.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
<p>Many consumers don't realize that all tankless water systems are not the same. Also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, tankless heaters provide hot water when you need it. Unlike other water heaters, this type of water heater does not lose energy while in standby mode, allowing you to save more money over the long-term. Ferran Services is here to answer any question you might have, determine the perfect fit for your household, and provide proper installation.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Repair Kent</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>

We provide quality repair and installation service that gives you peace of mind. Tankless water heaters can be installed anywhere inside your home. High-efficiency water heater products that save you money on utility costs.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>The average cost for a plumber to install a water heater is about $80 per hour. If the sacrificial anode rod is not replaced once it has been fully corroded, your hot water storage tank will begin to corrode, meaning you will probably have to replace it prematurely. One or both heating elements may have burned out and need replacing.

<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended. Depending on where you live, there may be one or more thermostats to deliver the best comfort; one to control the tubing water supply temperature, one to control different zones throughout the home, and one for outside the home.</p>

Best performance comes from gas units, as electric units are not Energy Star-rated. Many homeowners in our area are choosing to switch to a tankless water heater for many reasons. Homeowners are so attached to the idea of storage tanks when it comes to hot water that they find it a bit difficult to imagine how a tankless system might operate.</p>

<p>Whether you need emergency repairs to your existing system, or are considering upgrading your hot water heater, we can help you understand the cost and energy saving benefits of the options available. Some models, known as single point units, install close to the water source and are fairly inexpensive to purchase and install. That varies with the location and design of the unit, quality of installation, maintenance schedule and water quality.</p>
<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur.

A gas water heater installed entirely within a fully enclosed roof space, room or attached garage of an established home must have an energy rating of 3 stars or more.</p>
<p>Power venting a water heater costs about $500 to $1,000 more than a passive or direct vent system. By 2024, North America is expected to command more than 45% of the global tankless water heater market , according to Goldstein Research. Insulate the hot water pipe coming from the water heater.
