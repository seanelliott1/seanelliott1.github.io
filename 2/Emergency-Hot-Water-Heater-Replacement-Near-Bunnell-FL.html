<h2>Water Heater Services Bunnell Florida</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
