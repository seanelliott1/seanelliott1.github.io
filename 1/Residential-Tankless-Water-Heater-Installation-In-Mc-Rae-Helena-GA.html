The life expectancy of a water heater is typically eight to twelve years and, here in our area, it will typically be fueled by gas or electric. Follow these steps to install the new water heater. But there is one possibility of resolving these problems once and for all, and that is a tankless water heater.</p>

Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>
