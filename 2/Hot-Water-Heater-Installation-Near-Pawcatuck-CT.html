<h2>Water Heater Services Pawcatuck Connecticut</h2>
<p>Water heaters can run into several problems if not maintained properly. We provide prompt, reliable repairs and service. Because of their high-powered burners, tankless heaters need to be installed in a well-vented space for safe operation. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is always ready.

You cannot run a short blast, or a fine trickle of water from the hot taps, as the tankless water heater will not activate under such a low demand flow. Deposits inside the heat exchanger can cause the outlets from the tankless system to become clogged. A heating element and a water storage tank are required in conventional heaters.</p>
<p>Indirect water heaters use heat from a boiler. Radiant heating is a type of heating setup where the heat is supplied by electric wiring or hot water tubes installed into or under the flooring, and sometimes walls and ceilings.
