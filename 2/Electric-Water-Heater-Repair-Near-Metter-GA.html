<p>A 2-gallon expansion tank works with water heaters up to 50 gallons. The build-up of excess sediment inside your water tank may cause it to heat a lower volume of H2O. Multiple units can be plumbed in parallel to increase the volume output of hot water. 2. Tankless water heaters deliver hot water faster. Because tankless models can deliver better performance and energy efficiency - that's why. We are the most trusted HVAC contractor, providing professional water heater installation and repair services.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Replacement Metter</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>Today's solar water heating system consists of a large storage tank, a solar collector mounted on the roof and a small pump operated by an electronic control. There are two types of water heaters and both have their positives and negatives depending on your water heating needs. Save yourself the frustration and cost of necessary repairs (or even replacement ) down the line and hire a professional to begin with.</p>
<p>Sometimes water heaters will stop working when a pilot light goes out or if a part malfunctions. That's why the performance of tankless water heaters is measured by how many gallons per minute (GPM) the heater will deliver at a desired Temperature Rise. Larger units can heat water for your entire house. A tankless water heater not only eliminates the need for a bulky storage tank, it's a great way to reduce your household energy costs.</p>
<p>Instead you'll have to remove the metal thermostat cover on the side of the water heater, pull out the insulation and hold the tester near the wires leading into the top of the high-temperature cutoff switch (see Figure A). Tankless units take about 15 seconds to bring water up to temperature, but you still have to wait for that hot water to arrive at your shower head or faucet, just as you do with a tank-type heater.</p>
