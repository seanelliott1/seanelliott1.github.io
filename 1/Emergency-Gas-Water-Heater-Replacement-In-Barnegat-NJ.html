Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>

Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants.

Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Additional materials: some of the tankless systems will also be incompatible with the location and setup of older storage tank models. Many, like Navien tankless water heaters, qualify for energy efficiency rebates and credits from local utility companies because they are certified Energy Star products. Further, some gas condensate tanks cost almost three times as much as a traditional gas storage tank.

<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed.

If you have a gas power heater, you have to install it about eighteen inches off the ground. When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>

<p>A concentric vent, which has an exhaust pipe inside a larger air-intake pipe, simplifies installation because only one hole needs to be cut in the wall. Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000.
