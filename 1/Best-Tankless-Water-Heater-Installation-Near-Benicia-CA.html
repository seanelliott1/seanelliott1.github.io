<h2>Water Heater Services Benicia California</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>The water heater produces loud popping or cracking noises during use. So when you're experiencing issues, such as not enough hot water or no hot water at all, your first response may be just to replace it altogether. A tankless water heater usually requires a 1-inch gas pipe from the meter to the water heater. We take the guesswork out of water heater replacement. Foam pipe insulation minimizes heat loss through hot-water pipes.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>

<p>The word average” is important: it's possible that your current water heater is still going at age 20, or might quit at age 8.
