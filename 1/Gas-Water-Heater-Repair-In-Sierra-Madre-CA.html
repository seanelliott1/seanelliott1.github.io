Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs. The first kind works similarly to the hot rod in that an electric heating element heats the water. This then makes textiles, cloths, papers, and wood into potential fire hazards if left carelessly near the heating element of the heater.</p>

New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
