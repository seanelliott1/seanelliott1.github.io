Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>

When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank.
