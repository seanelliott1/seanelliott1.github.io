Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>

The tankless unit also uses a PVC flue pipe, which can be installed when a standard chimney is either not available or not practical. Water heaters are not products that are meant to last for a lifetime, thus, there are times in which your water heater will need to be repaired. At PV, we perform high quality, professionally audited installations of natural gas tankless water heaters.</p>

Installing heating systems in your home can help you maintain a constant temperature. A tankless water heater only heats water when it's needed, which means lower water heating costs and no more having to worry about running out of hot water.

<p>Tankless water heater works rather differently from the conventional water heating system - it does not require a tank for hot water storage and it is more environment friendly as the system avoids standby energy consumption.
