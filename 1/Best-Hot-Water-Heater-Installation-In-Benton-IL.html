<h2>Water Heater Services Benton Illinois</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work.

<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ).

If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity.

As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>

Less expensive to run - Because these systems only consume energy when there's a demand for hot water, they're more fuel efficient than storage systems, which must keep up a steady supply of heat to maintain water temperature. 1) I needed a unit big enough to supply me with hot water for at least one shower and sink running at the same time. These models deliver continuous hot water when you need it and they can be easily installed in places where tank water heaters can't go, including closets and bathrooms.</p>
