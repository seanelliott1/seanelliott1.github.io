<h2>Water Heater Services Livingston California</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Your contractor does not require any special training or previous experience with tankless water heaters. Installing a tankless water heater is a greater upfront investment, but these units can significantly cut the cost of monthly utilities. We perform all types of hot water heater repair services, from routine tank flushes and heating element replacement to leaking pipes. The traditional storage tank hot water heaters are generally going to provide most people the gallons per minute of water they desire.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters usually need more gas than even the biggest home furnaces. We have been specializing in San Jose water heaters including installation, replacement & repair since 1968. Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>

Traditional tank water heaters keep large capacities of water, commonly around 50 gallons at once. That said, the tankless system may qualify for state or federal tax rebates for energy-efficient appliances.</p>

<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
