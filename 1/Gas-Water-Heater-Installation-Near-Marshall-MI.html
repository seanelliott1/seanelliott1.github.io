Tankless water heaters work in almost any environment when mounted inside or outside your home or business. A water heater expansion tank costs $40 to $200 with labor adding another $50 to $150.</p>

<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy.

You'll also notice it's no longer necessary to run the water until it heats up. Although it costs more upfront, in the long run a tankless water heater is a money-saver.
