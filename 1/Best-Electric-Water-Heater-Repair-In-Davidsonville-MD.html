<p>So, when your water heater stops working, you need professional help—fast. Once the union is disconnected disconnect the rest of the pipe ONLY on the heater you are replacing. The cost of a space heating water heating combination unit is higher than that of a separate heater and furnace. This requires the services of a qualified commercial plumber who can respond to problems or concerns quickly and professionally.</p>
<p>2. Electrical tankless water heaters can require upgraded electrical service of much higher amperage than you currently have. When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters function differently from standard water heaters - a water flow sensor controls the water flow into the heater. Our plumbers will get you the best tankless water heater for your home and set it up for you fast.

<p>Once that hot water is gone, you will have to wait for a new 30 or 50 gallon tank to be heated again in order to have hot water. Tankless units supply a steady stream of hot water with no waiting and no running short. This cuts down on the wait time for hot water, provides you with a limitless supply, and allows for the whole family to gain access to hot water without waiting for your tank to refill. A typical tankless water heater installation can take a crew of 2 technicians an average of 6-10 hours, depending on installation requirements.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>Connect the water supply line to the water heater valves following the manufacturer's instructions. HomeWorks is proud to be the Twin Cities' tankless water heater experts. Similarly, tank style water heaters have different venting requirements than tankless models do, and there is a good chance that your home's existing venting will need to be revamped should you choose to install a tankless model.

<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>If the tank is cold or very hot, it may be difficult to get the expected changes when dialing in different temperatures on the thermostat. Next, the water heater must be connected to a fuel source. Before removing your old water heater, we'll assess your property's specific needs and recommend the most cost-effective option.
