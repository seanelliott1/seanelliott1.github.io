<p>During the course of an average home occupancy, a resident is bound to face that moment where they need to replace a water heater. Traditional tank water heaters can become rusted or corroded over time. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently prepared. Importantly, all types of tankless water heaters use at least some electricity to operate the control systems. Run clean water through the heater for a few minutes, using the same pump arrangement as before.</p>

<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas.
