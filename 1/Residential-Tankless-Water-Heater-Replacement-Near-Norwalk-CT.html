<h2>Water Heater Services Norwalk Connecticut</h2>
<p>Like any other things on the world, a hot water heater tank has its own parts. If a hot water faucet is turned on (such as if you take a shower), the water goes through a heat exchanger as it does so, meaning that this type of tankless water heater provides "on-demand" hot water without using a tank; this is something like an "on-demand" heater, but the boiler or furnace in a home heats the water directly, which means that the tankless coil water heater works best during the cold months when a home's heating system is on all or most of the time.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>Instead, when a flow-activated switch comes on, the heat exchanger turns on and heats the water as you need it. Tankless water heaters come in point-of-use styles like a coffee pot plumbed into the water system, or as whole-house units.

<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed.
