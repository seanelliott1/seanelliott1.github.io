<h3>Water Tank Repair Tonganoxie Kansas 66086</h3>
<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank. If you want to save money, invest in professional water heater installation. Keeping your water heater in good working order is always the best first step.</p>
<p>A lot goes into installation, including safety, plumbing permits from the county, and gas, electrical, or other connections. For starters, with an electric hot water heater you you can kill the gas line coming into the house, if you already have one or completely eliminate the need to put one in, if you do. This will leave you with one less bill to worry about. As these heating systems are tankless, your risk of flooding is diminished.</p>
<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>You should flush your water heater once per year to help remove sediment or rust that may be building up. This will greatly increase the life of your water heater and can even extend it beyond the manufacturer's warranty timeframe. Many of our customers see the benefit of installing tankless water heaters because they're compact, efficient and reported to save nearly 40% on energy costs ( DOE ). And the harder your heater has to work, the more it will be exposed to high temperatures and make the tank brittle.</p>
<p>The main advantage of using a tankless water heater system is that they eliminate the extra cost of keeping 40 to 50 gallons of water hot in a storage tank, so you waste less energy. Tankless water heaters only heat water on an as-needed basis and will never run out of hot water during normal operation. It may be time to consider a tankless system. When the gas fumes from a gas water heater travel up and out the draft diverter on top of the gas water heater, they go to the outside of your house through a vent.</p>
