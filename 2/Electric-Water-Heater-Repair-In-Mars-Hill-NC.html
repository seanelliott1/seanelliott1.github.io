<h2>Water Heater Services Mars Hill North Carolina</h2>
<p>Many individuals are curious as to when do you need a new water heater. Call Lee's Plumbing: Once the plumbing experts arrive, they will assess the situation and walk you through the necessary repairs. These systems heat the water as it is requested, which is why they are also known as on demand” water heaters. Tankless models only require enough power to heat the amount of water needed at any given moment, meaning they use less energy, which translates to utility savings. It's important for homeowners in Bucks and Montgomery County to also consider the efficiency, cost, and size of their new water heater.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
<p>Our technicians are experienced enough to handle all brands and models of water heaters such as Racold, Venus, etc. Relying on your plumber's hot water heater system replacement recommendation may not be the best choice for you or your hot water system installation. If your water heater was plumbed with copper piping, you may need to cut the pipes. If you plan on holding onto the property for some time, a tankless water heater might be a good option.</p>

<p>Often times newer and larger water heaters will not fit in this space, because they have more insulation than they used.

We realize the cost effects of outdated technology on your energy bills and we can help you upgrade to an efficient design that helps you save costs.</p>
<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>
<p>Sometimes water heaters will stop working when a pilot light goes out or if a part malfunctions. That's why the performance of tankless water heaters is measured by how many gallons per minute (GPM) the heater will deliver at a desired Temperature Rise. Larger units can heat water for your entire house. A tankless water heater not only eliminates the need for a bulky storage tank, it's a great way to reduce your household energy costs.</p>
