<h2>Water Heater Services Liberty Texas</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>When a hot water tap is turned on, water from your pipes enters the water heater and passes through the heat exchanger. It provides you with enough hot water to wash your dishes and your clothes, to bathe and shower, and to heat the water for cleaning cabinets, mopping floors, washing your hair, and more. For the home that has an average consumption of hot water a 40 gallon tank is normally sufficient. Emergency Water and Gas Shut Off Valve - Also known as "WAGS".</p>

Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
