<h2>Water Heater Services New Paltz New York</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Water is leaking from the hot water heater tank. However, as long as your water usage at any given time is below the maximum allowable flow rate, tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water. This is often provided by either a flame, on a gas water heater, or a heating element, on an electric water heater. They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Repair New Paltz</h3>
<p>We work with today's top systems to ensure your trusty water heater continues to operate smoothly. This will help to prevent sediment and scale build up in your water heater keeping it in the best shape possible. For a tankless water heater that makes 40 gallons or less of hot water every day, owners enjoy about 34% more energy efficiency over traditional heaters For those who utilize a lot of hot water (more than 80 gallons) every day, this efficiency is around 14 percent.</p>
<p>The new Federal Water Heater Energy Standards have produced a burst of energy in new water heater design and technology Here's a cool Infographic from the U.S. Department of Energy. Because tankless water heaters are a compact size, they don't take up a lot of space. They save energy (and save you money), they provide unlimited hot water, they're small and compact, they never leak and don't contribute to harmful metals in your water.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
<p>When you lose power, there is a reserve of hot water for a short time period. You have no hot water: If you don't have hot water in your home, your water heater clearly isn't working. If your water heater leaks around the base, is over 10 years old, works erratically or doesn't work at all at this point, it's probably time to replace it. If you aren't comfortable working with gas or electricity, do yourself a favor and call a professional plumber.</p>

If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>During power outages, tankless units will not produce hot water. From saving money to unlimited hot water, these units are ideal for many homeowners. If you're running out of hot water all the time, the problem might not be your water heater. Water heaters should be professionally serviced at least once a year.
