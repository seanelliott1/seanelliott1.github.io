<h3>Water Tank Repair Red Oak Iowa 51566</h3>
<p>A small electric spark that ignites the gas usually starts the units, little cause for alarm. But it is important to note right up front that the cost of converting your current system to tankless or "demand" is more costly then substituting a conventional tank. If you want to save money, invest in professional water heater installation. Keeping your water heater in good working order is always the best first step.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater can place a virtually unlimited supply of hot water within your reach 24 hours a day while saving you time, energy, money, and space. First of all, it is important to understand the basic operation of a tankless water heater. New storage tank water heaters are required to operate more efficiently, and tankless (on-demand) water heaters are even more efficient than that. This indicates what sort of energy source is used to heat the water.</p>
<p>Once the water has reached its set temperature it goes to the supply needing it via the hot water pipe at the top of the tank. Our pros can help you decide on the right water heater to fit your needs. While this type of malfunction can be irksome, repairing or replacing a thermostat is one of the least invasive repair jobs that can crop up when it comes to water heater service. Tankless: You'll need to know the flow rate of each appliance, fuel source and the rise in temperature needed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gas tankless water heaters need you to have the right kind of gas - which could either be propane or natural gas - before you install any unit. Plus, with technology that operates only when hot water is needed, ultra-efficient heating coils, no pilot light and no storage tank, you save on energy and utility costs. Energy Efficiency: As water heaters age, they become less energy efficient, using more gas or electricity to generate less hot water.</p>
