Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it.

A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
