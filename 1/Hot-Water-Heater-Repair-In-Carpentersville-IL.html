<h2>Water Heater Services Carpentersville Illinois</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits. If there is no hot water in the water heater, this may be because of a lack of power to heating the elements, such as tripped circuit breaker, a blown fuse handling water heater circuit, a faulty electric thermostat, or a faulty upper electric heating element. The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>
<p>Coat the threaded ends with pipe joint compound and screw the first nipple into the gas valve.

<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>Removal of current system: another issue to consider is that the removal and disposal costs of your current water heater, which can be upwards of $500 dollars, based on your area. Gas water heaters use a gas powered pilot light to heat the water that you enjoy in your home.
