<h2>Water Heater Services Maysville Kentucky</h2>
<p>No matter how careful we are with our things, there comes a time when we need to replace them. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a bit more than a traditional storage tank water heater, but, tankless varieties last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before self-destructing, possibly flooding your basement or home, depending on their location If you want to hit a home run,” install a tankless water heater at each hot water outlet.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
<p>The conventional gas storage water heater is roughly $100 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over the same 15 year time period. This provides an endless supply of hot water regardless of how many people need to take showers, how much laundry needs to get done, or how often you need to run the dishwasher. Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>

<p>Water is then heated by a copper heat exchanger fueled by gas or electricity, depending on your system. You're also not as limited when it comes to where your tankless water heater can be installed as they're safer. In addition to choosing a water heater with a good warranty, check consumer reporting websites and reviews from individual owners. The first step is to find an appropriate wall to mount the water heater to. For a whole house water heater, it makes sense to place it close to where most hot water is being used.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters are efficient but expensive. If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced. Sometimes they are called an in-line heater, as it only heats the water it needs as it passes through, and therefore energy is not wasted by heating extra water all day that is not in use.

<p>Get your water heater flushed out regularly to keep it running well. The only greater percentage is heating and cooling costs.
