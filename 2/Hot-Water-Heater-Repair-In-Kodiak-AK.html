<h2>Water Heater Services Kodiak Alaska</h2>
<p>It is an option to install your own electric tankless water heater. This price estimate includes the cost of a basic tank water heater, installation, materials, removal of the old unit, and the cost of any permits. These use a heat pump to pull heat from the surrounding air and transfer it to the water in the tank via a compressor and coils. TML Service Experts can help you conserve hot water and decrease water heating costs with ENERGY STAR-rated models, installing low-flow fixtures and suggesting other energy-efficiency upgrades.</p>
<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>The new line of A. Smith electric tankless water heaters provide an energy efficient and easy-to-install solution for your home or business. Whether you have an electric or gas water heater, it needs something to cycle the heat on and off.

And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>
