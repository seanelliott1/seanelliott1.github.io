Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>
<p>In addition to the upfront cost, which carries significant weight in the decision for many, other factors also include the number of people in the house, any remodeling in the home, as well as the expense to operate the heater. If you see a dip in water pressure whenever you turn on your hot water, there may be some damage to the plumbing lines.

Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it.
