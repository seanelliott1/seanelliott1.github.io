<h2>Water Heater Services Spring Branch Texas</h2>
<p>Water Heaters are a necessary household appliance that supplies all of your warm water needs, from cooking to bathing. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often. We also want enough hot water for our needs and energy costs savings. Many people don't know much about water heaters or water heater repairs. A well-maintained tankless water heater can last for a long time. Typical anticipated lifetimes for these water heaters are 8-12 years for conventional and 10-15 years for high-efficiency.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>The conventional gas storage water heater is roughly $100 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over the same 15 year time period. This provides an endless supply of hot water regardless of how many people need to take showers, how much laundry needs to get done, or how often you need to run the dishwasher. Wrap a rag around the heating element to keep water from dripping down. One is to store it in a tank and heat it up there; this is what conventional heaters do. Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>

<p>We'll take a look at some potential water heater malfunctions below. However, tankless varieties are known to last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before falling apart due to corrosion or part failure of some sort. Depending on where you have the water heater located inside your house, a leak could result in significant property damage.</p>

If there's a problem with the heater's thermocouple, the problem is critical because it's actually a safety instrument that detects when the pilot light is on. If the pilot isn't lit the gas valve won't turn the gas on. When a hot water tap is turned on, water enters the tankless water heater.</p>

Navien's Condensing Tankless Water Heaters can provide an endless supply of hot water on demand because our units activate the second you open the hot water tap. Improperly installed gas lines can leak, creating an explosion risk. Make sure the power is connected to the heater, then reset the thermostat.</p>
<p>The water heater is a fairly simple appliance. When the distance between heater and fixture exceeds 50 feet, look for units with a built-in recirculation pump, which saves water and reduces waiting time. If your water heater is leaking contact us and we can assist you in shutting off the leaking water heater to help minimize any possible water damage. Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, do not store water.</p>
<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

<p>There are several common complaints we hear everyday about Bucks County water heaters. Tankless water heaters are much more energy efficient than tank-based water heaters. Tank-style water heaters may be the most common, but the truth is they're not without flaws. If you have a smaller family, or you're just a couple without kids then we have a unit for you as well in a smaller capacity energy-efficient unit that will keep the hot water coming.</p>

Installing a whole-house water softener can mitigate calcium buildup, lengthening the life of your water heater. We offer both conventional and tankless water heater options, rebates and eco-friendly discounts. But, as the concept of heating water on demand become more popular, and because tankless water heaters are more energy efficient, homebuilders began installing them.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
