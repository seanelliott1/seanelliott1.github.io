<h2>Water Heater Services Ligonier Indiana</h2>
<p>When it's time to replace your old water heater, you'll want it done fast and at a fair price.

Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82.
