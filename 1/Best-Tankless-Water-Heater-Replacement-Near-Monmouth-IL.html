<h2>Water Heater Services Monmouth Illinois</h2>
<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through.

Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
<p>The cold water will enter the tank, then the water will be heated and then the hot water will be stored until there will be demands coming from the bathroom shower or tap, or the dishwasher or kitchen sink.
