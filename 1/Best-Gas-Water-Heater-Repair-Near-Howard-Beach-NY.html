<h2>Water Heater Services Howard Beach New York</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
<p>Sometimes water heaters cannot be repaired or it makes more sense to replace them after they have exceeded their expected service life. Rather than ignoring issues with your system, scheduling professional water heater repair in Laguna Hills comes with plenty of benefits. Water heaters employ a significant amount of energy at your home, accounting for about 20 percent of your total energy use.
