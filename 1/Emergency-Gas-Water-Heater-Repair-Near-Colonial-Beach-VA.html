The traditional storage tank hot water heaters are generally going to provide most people the gallons per minute of water they desire.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank.

However, if you're looking to make your home more energy efficient, our technicians may recommend replacing a less-efficient unit with one that heats better and uses less energy.</p>

<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Colonial Beach VA</h3>
<p>Before you get a new water heater, you'll want to determine which system best meets your family's demands. Storage tank sizes are determined by the size and hot water requirements of the household it is to serve. The key is picking the most efficient water heater large enough to handle your needs. While a water heater replacement is needed on occasion, a lot of times homeowners and business owners don't know when a replacement is needed.</p>
<p>In addition, you will benefit from adjusting your hot water temperature with the changing seasons to get the right temperature from the faucets. Manufacturers recommend that certified electricians or plumbers install tankless water heaters. Traditional electric hot water heater tanks take up as much as 16 square feet of floor space in your home, but a tankless water heater is very compact and can be fixed on almost any wall either inside or outside your home.</p>
<p>The most efficient storage tank has an energy factor of about67, but according to Energy Star, some tankless units have energy factors as high as95. Whole-home water heating systems may cost a little more upfront than a tank-style heater, but over time these systems usually pay for themselves time and time again. We'll also test for rust and do everything we can to keep your water heater running well so you can always have the hot water you need.</p>

<p>If you need professional water heater installation or replacement, you have come to the right place. Also, test all wires in the water heater with a non-contact voltage tester to confirm the power is off before touching the wires. The water heater is capable of heating nearly 4 gallons per minute in cold weather, or up to 6 gallons during summer months. When you replace a water heater, you are also expected to bring the water heating system up to current building codes While the cost of doing this is not directly part of the cost of the water heater, the two should be calculated together to find an estimate of the total expense.</p>
<p>These water heater systems do not occupy much space and rather easy to use. Just like other mechanical appliances in your home, water heaters also require periodic service and maintenance for smooth and uninterrupted functioning. Call us 24 hours a day 1-866-946-7842 to speak with a water heater expert- we will help diagnose an issue, check your water heater manufacturer's warranty status and schedule an appointment for repair services.</p>
<p>Be careful to ensure that your water heater is convenient and safe in case of future servicing. Remember, with tankless, there is no preheated reservoir of water. Once you close the hot water tap, the unit senses that the flow of water has stopped and shuts off the heating element. Get up to 36 months to pay for your new water heater, subject to credit approval. Condensing water heaters have a tank like a conventional storage tank water heater, but they capture hot exhaust gases that would normally be expelled from a home out the flue.</p>
<p>Without a building permit, your home owner's insurance may deny a claim for damage caused by a failed water heater. As long as these needs are met, it is convenient for tankless water heating to take place in the bathroom. These water heaters operate in tandem with your home heating system and are often seen in conjunction with boilers. There are ways to prevent sediment buildup, including regular maintenance, using a water softener to reduce the number of contaminants in your water, and keeping your overall water heater temperature at or below 130 degrees.</p>
<p>While a traditional tank costs anywhere from $300 to $600 (not including installation costs), most tankless units cost at least $700 and can vary widely in price from there. We'll come out to assess your tankless unit and identify the root cause. First and foremost, take a look at your water heater's thermostat. If you need water heater replacement, we'll talk you through all your available options. The telltale sign that your water heater needs replacing is a slow drip underneath, usually showing up as a trail of rusty water.</p>
