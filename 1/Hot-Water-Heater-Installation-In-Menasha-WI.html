<h2>Water Heater Services Menasha Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Your next door neighbor was up all night dealing with a busted water heater and you just spent the last half hour listening to him complain. Solar water heaters use a storage tank that stores water heated by the sun. Haven Heating and Air Conditioning is your local tankless water heater repair specialist, get in touch with us today. It's these two things: Flow Rate and Gallons Per Minute that determine what size heater you need and whether it should be gas or electric. There are several factors that can affect your water heater. Whether it's installation of a brand new tank or tankless, repair of an existing tank or preventative and regular maintenance to ensure that your tank is operating at its maximum potential, the experts at AirPlus Heating & Cooling can handle it. We are able to quickly and efficiently install a new unit in your home, should it be beyond repair.</p>

Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation Menasha</h3>
<p>The two most important areas you have to focus on when installing a tankless water heater are making sure you have the right size fittings and that you have a proper ventilation system set up for the unit.

The most important decision regarding water heaters will be choosing whether you want to install a unit with a conventional storage tank or a tankless model.</p>
<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker. This happens because several feet of pipes separate the faucet from the water heater, and the water cools as it sits unused in the pipes. Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute.
