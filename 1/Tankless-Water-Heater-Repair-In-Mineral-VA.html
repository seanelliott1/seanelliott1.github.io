Having an incorrect setting can cause your water to be too cold, too hot, or cause your heating elements to work constantly. If your tank is gas powered, you'll find gas connections below the tank at the pilot light. The idea behind this type of water heater is to reduce wasted energy by heating the water as it runs through the pipe instead of keeping it in a tank and spending energy to keep it at one temperature twenty four hours a day.</p>

Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. Even with a tankless a.k.a. instantaneous water heater, you won't have instant hot water whenever you open the kitchen faucet or another outlet.
