<p>The worst traditional electric heaters are 93 percent efficient. Maybe your hot water heater has sprung a leak or it's just stopped working. If your home uses less than 42 gallons of hot water daily, a tankless water heater can operate up to 34 percent more efficiently than a storage tank water heater.

Tankless water heaters come in a variety of sizes for different applications, such as a whole-house tankless water heater, a source for a remote bathroom or hot tub, or as a boiler to provide hot water for a home heating system.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a tankless water heater, you will need to determine your hot water usage, which is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and figure out your maximum hot water demand. Whether you go with an electric tankless unit or a gas one, you will save money on your utility bills. In some cases, a tankless water heater is located in a completely different location than the old water heater. If you have a tankless coil water heater, and you heat with oil, follow steps for "no heat." If you have a gas hot water tank, do not reset breaker or re-light pilot.</p>
<p>While new storage water heaters are more efficient, they have had to grow in size. But if you have a large family, you'll likely need the faster heating capability of a gas unit. Call water heaters repair services. We see this a lot on traditional electric water heaters, which use a pair of electric heating elements to heat the tank. After your water heater tank has filled with water, turn on the circuit breaker at the main power box.</p>
