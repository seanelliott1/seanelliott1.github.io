<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play.

If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>Next, your installer will mount the actual heating unit. For most households, the ideal hot water temperature is between 120 and 140 degrees. Instead of fighting over who gets the first shower in the morning, you don't have to worry about that with a new water heater.
