However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>I spoke with a technician who has seen tankless water heaters fail due to hard water deposits in as little as two years here in Minnesota. Similarly, in case you find a pool of water on the floor where your electric water heater is installed, you should urgently call a plumber, as it again is a crisis situation.

You waste more water because tankless heaters have to heat the water first since there isn't a tank full already waiting.

They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
<p>Some homeowners find that local building codes have changed and that after their water heater is repaired, upgrades to the venting system, drain pan and other components are needed. Electric water heaters typically last a year or two longer than gas models, but not always. They also tend to have many fewer problems with them than other types of water heating systems. If you need your water heater replaced, we're up for the task.</p>
