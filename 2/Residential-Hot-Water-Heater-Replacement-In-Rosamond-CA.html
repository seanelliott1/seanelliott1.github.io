Listed below are the warranty phone numbers for the top water heater manufacturers - be sure to have your model number and serial number handy prior to beginning your call.</p>
<p>Water heaters need their own electrical circuits. If there is no hot water in the water heater, this may be because of a lack of power to heating the elements, such as tripped circuit breaker, a blown fuse handling water heater circuit, a faulty electric thermostat, or a faulty upper electric heating element. The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker. Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>
