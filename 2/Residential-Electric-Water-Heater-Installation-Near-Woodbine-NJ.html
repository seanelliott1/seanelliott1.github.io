<h2>Water Heater Services Woodbine New Jersey</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most common and easiest way to heat water is by the use of a gas hot water heater, and this might be due to the fact that gas is capable of getting the tank up to operating temperature roughly twice as quickly as its electric counterpart, and the cost is also approximately half as much as electricity would cost. Tank water heaters are great and very reliable, but if you are looking for a more energy-efficient that can save you a lot of money, tankless water heaters are the way to go. At All About Plumbing & Septic, we are able to repair and replace tankless water heaters, as well as provide quality water heater installation service More and more people are investing in tankless water heaters because when it's not in use, it doesn't consume energy; with traditional tank water heaters, they are constantly heating water within in a tank.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>This helps ensure that your new hot water heater is installed properly and will provide you and your residents and employees with years of hot water. Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>Storage water heaters lose heat and can cost a lot of money in maintenance over time. The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>

If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
