<h2>Water Heater Services Des Moines Iowa</h2>
<p>Water heater maintenance is one of the most important yet overlooked things home owners need to be aware of. Whether residing in a fairly new or older dwelling, it is very important that you inspect the appliance at regular intervals and make sure that it is working properly. You generally have to install a tank water heater indoors, as they cannot tolerate harsh weather conditions. There are several ways that you can benefit from having a tankless water heater installed. It should be noted that, for sizing purposes, the typical worst-case scenario (the middle of winter) should be assumed for the incoming groundwater temperature to ensure adequate hot-water availability year-round.</p>

If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a tankless water heater will directly heat the water without using a storage tank. The nationally recognized temperature for when scalding is significantly more likely to occur is 125° F, so it is generally not recommended to set the water heater higher than this. A tank water heater makes for an excellent water heater for many homes because of its relatively low upfront cost, its large hot water capacity, and its power.</p>
<p>Circuit breaker for an electric heater trips. Tankless water heaters are perfect for vacation and second homes that are not constantly occupied. Tankless water heaters also use gas to heat water; however, tankless systems heat water on demand instead of expending energy maintaining a full tank of hot water. The water inside of a tankless water heater is less likely to rust. This kind of heater can deliver a nearly endless source of hot water, because it's always heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>This can happen if the gas supply is interrupted, the gas valve is turned off, or a gust of wind blows out the pilot light.
