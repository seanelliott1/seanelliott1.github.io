<h2>Water Heater Services Wakefield Rhode Island</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results.

They use electricity to pump heat from the air or the ground to your water tank, using less energy than traditional water heaters.</p>

Larger units can heat water for your entire house. A tankless water heater not only eliminates the need for a bulky storage tank, it's a great way to reduce your household energy costs.</p>

There can be huge variances in what different gas fitters charge for hot water system installation cost. If this happens, you should reduce the demand for hot water by limiting simultaneous applications, and you may want to consider resetting your unit. Traditional tank water heaters take up valuable space in a basement, attic or closet—space you could use.</p>

<p>Tankless hot water heaters are also a good choice for most retro projects, and should be considered a good choice for second homes and weekend retreats where the percentage of standing hot water is wasted. Flexible copper connectors are easier to install than solid copper, especially when the existing pipes and the tank inlets don't line up. But not all local codes allow them. Age of the Heating Unit: The average life of a water heater is about 8 to 12 years.</p>
<p>Our plumbing contractors can also help you find a larger unit for your home if you're planning on upgrading, in addition to being able to install any new hot water pipes needed to power additional appliances in your home.
