Now that you've read up on how to drain your water heater, be sure the gas is turned off at the valve, not just at the control module. VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>
<p>We handle gas connections, wiring, and combustion vents to ensure that your new water heater performs optimally. The average cost of a tankless water heater installed is around $1,500-$2,000. And get a FREE complete water heater system inspection. On average, tankless water heaters provide 2 to 5 gallons of hot water per minute.

<p>If you ever see boiling water coming out of your faucet, or can see steam, you need to turn off your heater immediately and get a professional to inspect it. Boiling water usually means that the thermostat is broken and is overheating.

This means that the cause is somewhere between the water heater and the fixtures.</p>
<p>Once the heating elements fry, it usually costs about as much to replace the entire heater as it does to swap in new elements. Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
<p>We even offer emergency water heater repair service, for no additional charge. A tankless system avoids this problem completely by only heating the water that you call for. That's the promise of tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, which produce hot water only when you turn on the faucet, start a cycle on the washing machine, switch on the dishwasher, or otherwise call for hot water. Get the best tankless water heater installation and repair available in your community by calling (336) 884-7056 for reliable service in Greensboro, NC and the surrounding areas.</p>
