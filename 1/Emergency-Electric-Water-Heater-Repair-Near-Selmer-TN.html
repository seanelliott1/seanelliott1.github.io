Many of today's tankless water heater models are wi-fi compatible and can be monitored with a smart phone. In most cases, the water heater always gives way to the furnace thereby depriving you of hot water supply. A cracked or corroded storage tank is also a sign you need to replace your entire unit.</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>
