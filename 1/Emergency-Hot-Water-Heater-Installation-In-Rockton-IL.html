What it does is provide hot water on demand so you don't have to worry about the shower suddenly running cold. This water heater hangs on your wall and, instead of storing a large tank of water that is kept constantly hot-even when you're asleep or not at home-the tankless water heater produces hot water only when it's needed, as it's needed.</p>
