<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>Circuit breaker for an electric heater trips. Tankless water heaters are perfect for vacation and second homes that are not constantly occupied. Tankless water heaters also use gas to heat water; however, tankless systems heat water on demand instead of expending energy maintaining a full tank of hot water. The water inside of a tankless water heater is less likely to rust. This kind of heater can deliver a nearly endless source of hot water, because it's always heating a big amount of water.</p>
<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home. However, a broken thermostat can also tip the water temperature in the opposite direction and can mean that your hot water gets way too hot.

For a place that uses a lot of hot water and more then one outlet at one time then you do not want to get the standard tankless water heater. You could have an undersized heating element(s), failed element, a 240V heater wired to 120V service, etc.</p>
