<h2>Water Heater Services Walnut Creek California</h2>
<p>Below are some good reasons why you should consider a tankless hot water heater for your new or pre-existing home, office, workshop, or cabin project. There are other advantages to having a tankless water heater and that you will not have to worry about your young ones going down and playing with the facet that is on the outside of the water heater and taking a chance on getting burnt in the end with it. Plus you are not going to need to make sure that there is not unused hot water in your tankless water heater that would end up running the pipes in the long run.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>The voltage of most heaters range between 110V to 277V. This could happen at the top or bottom of the water heater, where the pipes come out. However, if your water looks rusty, has a funky smell, or produces a strange noise, it's time to call a professional for a hot water heater repair. The mobile home water heater never gets looked at till it breaks down, but just like your central heating boiler ay home, it should be serviced annually.</p>

<p>Many people are going towards getting tankless water heat so that they do not need to keep it maintained of another appliance. Energy Efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water, using about 35% less energy than a tank water heater. While it's true that the T&P Valve is likely to leak after testing it, the danger involved if it failed makes the risk of a leak worth it. If you want to see what could potentially happen due to a failed T&P, just Google "water heater blast" and check out the video at the website of that name.</p>

Over time, the heating element may wear out. If you decide to invest in a refurbished tankless water heater system, you need to be prepared for disappointment and having to invest more money in the future. A properly sized electric tankless water heater can do this, but to do so it puts a large surge of demand on your electric service.</p>

They also are very well insulated to conserve the heat that the tank maintains while holding heated water.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>While conventional tanks can last for 10 to 12 years, tankless water heaters typically last for 20 years or more. Most tank heaters are expected to last 8-10 years.
