A conventional water heater (tank) can last up to 15 years with proper maintenance. Most gas-powered tankless water heaters do qualify for a $300 federal tax rebate. Water heaters need space to operate safely and an improperly installed unit can be a constant source of danger in your home.</p>
<p>Our plumbers are water heater repair pros. We can find the problem and get your water heater leakproof in no time. Call or click today to schedule tankless water heater repair and start enjoying endless hot water again. Most manufacturers suggest the life expectancy of a water heater is eight to twelve years. If you only have electricity at your home, it is often cheaper to continue using that fuel source for water heating over paying to bury a propane tank or run a new natural gas line (if that is even a possibility).</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again. Eventually, it can burn out the heating elements in your water heater, shortening its lifespan. Open several hot water outlets for a couple of minutes to purge any air from the pipes and water heater.</p>

<p>Like your RVs heater, the tankless heater emits CO2 when the burner is on, and the CO2 needs to be vented outside the RV. Three inch tubing is a minimum and should be exhausted through the roof or side wall with the appropriate tubing and vent cap. Call VIP Plumbing when you need water heater repair or are getting error codes. Water heater failures are normal, but believe me, there are more noticeable in the winter months.</p>
<p>At Bill Howe Plumbing, we love tankless water heaters. Another option is to investigate solar power, supplemented by an energy efficient water heater tank powered by gas or electricity. Always on time and cost effective services. For a single-point tankless water heater suitable for a faucet in a laundry room or a shower, prices start at about $150, depending on the brand. The main advantage of a tankless water heater is that no water storage tank is required.</p>
<p>Your water heater is leaking: Any type of water leak is no good, but it can be especially bad if the water is coming from your water heater. Most water heaters rely on a natural draft to draw combustion fumes up the flue. Turn off the cold water valve at the top of the heater. Disconnect the pipes and remove the water heater. Since everyone will have a slightly unique situation in reconnecting their water heater, let me just offer you some tips and lists that will help you to determine your best approach.</p>
<p>If the hot water system installation needs additional fittings or if the plumbing or electrical installation requires upgrading, the hot water system installation cost rises.

Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
