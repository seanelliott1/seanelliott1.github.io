<h2>Water Heater Services Boerne Texas</h2>
<p>One modern day luxury that we often take for granted is the ability to have a hot bath or shower at the flick of a water faucet. But if you use hot water only in the morning and in the evening, like most full time working people do, your energy bill will go down substantially. It is very common for water heaters to have sediment buildups, either if the water has a high amount of minerals or the heater get older. It allows for significant energy savings and an endless supply of hot water. With a tankless hot water heater installation, you will no longer have to heat water all day and night.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Boerne Texas 78006</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>

<p>A concentric vent, which has an exhaust pipe inside a larger air-intake pipe, simplifies installation because only one hole needs to be cut in the wall. Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000. Hard water (meaning it has a higher mineral content) in San Diego and surrounding areas causes a scale buildup that can damage heating elements.</p>
