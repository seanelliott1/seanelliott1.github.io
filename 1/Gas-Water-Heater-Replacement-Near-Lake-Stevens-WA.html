<h2>Water Heater Services Lake Stevens Washington</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500.

<p>The climate can also affect how much the homeowner can save by opting for a tankless water heater. When it comes to your water heater, Radiant plumbers are equipped to perform maintenance, repairs, replacements, and also hot water heater installations. Tankless Water Heaters are much different from the traditional water heaters we have today. For example, electrical units don't need ventilation, so there's no need to install a ventilation line alongside a water line like you would with a gas unit.</p>
<p>Many people think that electric hot water heaters are very expensive, and there are commercials seen often that indicate that gas water heaters are a better choice because they cost less and they keep working when the power goes out. A broken unit can quickly leave you without any hot water, which is why it's good to know what warning signs to look for to get timely repair services. These replacement models have been designed to save on running costs by having no fixed pilot.</p>

With routine maintenance, you can avoid having to repair your water heater, and it will last much longer.

<p>Tankless Water Heater Installations also typically require a flush kit to be installed for maintenance purposes. Replacing the anode rod regularly will significantly increase the life span of the water heater. Popular water heater brands are popular because of their reputation, and brands vary in price.
