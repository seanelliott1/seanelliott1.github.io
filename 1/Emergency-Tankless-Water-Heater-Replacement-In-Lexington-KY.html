<h2>Water Heater Services Lexington Kentucky</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to hire a plumber for a water heater installation. Before you call the professionals, you can troubleshoot your malfunctioning hot water dispenser on your own. We take care of all your tankless water heater repair and installation services. We have provided outstanding plumbing services since 1980 and have plenty of experience with all types of water heaters. To remove the old water heater, shut off the valves on the two water lines (one inlet and one outlet) leading into the existing water heater.</p>
<p>A 2-gallon expansion tank works with water heaters up to 50 gallons. The build-up of excess sediment inside your water tank may cause it to heat a lower volume of H2O.
