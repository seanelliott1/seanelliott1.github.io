<h2>Water Heater Services Laurens South Carolina</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Improve your home's water and energy consumption with a tankless water heater. Endless hot water: Because tankless water heaters produce hot water on demand, your supply never runs out. Gas hot water heaters have changed over the years as now most of them have a igniter for lighting the pilot and a gas valve with built in diagnostics. Many homes have galvanized steel or plastic (CPVC) water supply pipes. As time goes on, your water heater naturally starts to fill itself with sediment at the bottom of the tank.</p>

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Laurens</h3>
<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families. As many homeowners look for ways to lower their energy costs, one area of improvement is water heating.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
<p>Call 260-493-2596 to find out if a tankless water heater is right for you. The water heater is also called hot water tank or hot water cylinder.

We offer water heater testing services and will look at the overall condition of your heater to help you decide if your system needs any repairs or a full water heater replacement. A water heater can also be tankless , which means the water is heated when hot water is needed and doesn't need to be stored in a tank.</p>

<p>Turn off the water and gas or electric before you begin, and take particular care to vent gas models properly. Use 2 T joints to divide the hot and cold water inlets, so as to fit the water heater onto one side and the shower, sink, bath or washbasin on the other side. With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>
<p>This is a great improvement over the standard tank water heater because if you wish to have more then one outlet running on those systems you need to have more then one unit working.

We also offer expert installations as well as reliable repair and maintenance services to keep your system working optimally. To begin the installation, temporarily thread the valve into the tank and take a measurement between the bottom of the valve and the floor place.</p>
