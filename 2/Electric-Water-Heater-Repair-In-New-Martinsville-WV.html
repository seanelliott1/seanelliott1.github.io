<h2>Water Heater Services New Martinsville West Virginia</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
<p>With hot water pipes adequately insulated with materials like foam pipe insulation sleeves, your plumber can help your home become more energy efficient. Similar to gas-fired tank-type systems, gas-fired tankless systems include a vent that removes any by-products created during the combustion process. Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>

<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors New Martinsville WV</h3>
<p>We service and install both gas or electric water heaters and tankless water heaters. To be sure your entire house is without hot water, check every hot water faucet and fixture.

Note: Our Customer Service Professionals are happy to help you determine this information over the phone if you are unable to find the specifications on your current water heater. Gas hot water problems or electric hot water heater problems can sometimes be easily fixed.

If you hear odd sounds when you use your shower, you should contact your water heater repair contractor because something is seriously wrong with the heater.</p>

Solar, tankless systems and fuel oil systems, however, can cost as much as $1,000 or more to install.</p>
