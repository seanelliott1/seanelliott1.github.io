In fact, a Rinnai tankless gas water heater uses up to 40 percent less energy than a traditional tank water heater. Our comprehensive service plan will make sure that your natural gas hot water system is fully maintained to keep it running at peak efficiency all year round. If your water heater was in storage closet, then you will be able to use this space for other things, such as household items and clothing.</p>

There are two types of water heaters and both have their positives and negatives depending on your water heating needs. Save yourself the frustration and cost of necessary repairs (or even replacement ) down the line and hire a professional to begin with.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas.

Improperly installed gas lines can leak, creating an explosion risk. Make sure the power is connected to the heater, then reset the thermostat.</p>
<p>There's never a good time to run out of hot water—especially if you're halfway through a shower. Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less).
