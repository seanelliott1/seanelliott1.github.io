<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

<p>Older water heaters tend to have parts that wear out over time due to corrosion and rusting. Never put insulation on the tin draft diverter located above the gas water heate. Over time, the heating element may wear out.

<p>This is because the water is flowing through the heating department without being heated to a particular temperature. General Electric also makes GeoSpring, a line of electric heat pump water heaters manufactured in the U.S. Because the water heater is used every day, multiple times a day, it can develop some wear and tear. When you reach out to Metro Plumbing, Heating & Air for drain cleaning you can be rest assured that you will receive superior service.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>Disconnect the connection between the inlet valve and the pipe which supplies the gas. The Rheem® Combination Boiler joins the benefits of a tankless water heater with those of a hydronic boiler—all in one one space-saving unit. While a typical water heater doesn't take up that much room, the additional space can be used for storage or other purposes. Metals inside your water heater can rust with time and can be a cause of rusty water flow.</p>
<p>If you're anything like the average homeowner, you use your water heater daily. Along with the insulated foam, water heaters are now made with a glass liner inside to prevent corrosion from the minerals in the water. Installing a gas tankless water heater involves mounting the unit, connecting gas and water lines, and installing a flue. Electric water heaters tend to only last 8 to 10 years before they need to be replaced.</p>
