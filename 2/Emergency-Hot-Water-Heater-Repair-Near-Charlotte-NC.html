<h2>Water Heater Services Charlotte North Carolina</h2>
<p>Electric tankless hot water heaters come in very useful sizes - from something that looks like a loaf of bread to some the size of a PC. All have the capability of providing instant hot water on demand. Tankless water heaters are all the rage. As for the cold water side, if you have a shut off valve that is in good shape, you'll want to cut below that so that you can keep the water on to the rest of the house and if not, you'll have to shut off the water at the main and I suggest installing a new valve while you have this all opened up. These standby losses may represent 10% to 20% of a home's yearly water heating expense.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
<p>Removal - Most plumbers will charge between $250 and $500 to take the old water heater out and take it away for proper disposal. That's where an annual tank flush can come in handy, as it can remove these harmful sediments and ensure that your hot water tank is working at maximum efficiency. Kids won't be attracted to the inviting spigot, since the unit looks more like a computer than a hot water processor. The issue here is that you have used a lot of energy to heat the entire tank's capacity yet you do not use all of it. This equates to wasted resources and it is certainly reflected on your energy bill.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Installation Charlotte</h3>
<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. Following a "heavy use" industry standard test, we compared the performance of gas and electric tankless water heaters with the performance of their conventional tank counterparts.</p>
<p>Scalding water is usually the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. What it means for you is that using a tankless electric heater you will never run out of hot water while in the shower. Sometimes individual units are used in a number of locations throughout a house, but most newer homes have one high-output tankless heater to supply hot water throughout the home. Fits your budget: There's a great water heater for every budget.</p>
<p>If you have a water heater with a re-circulation pump, we can check that the pump is working correctly and re-install the existing pump or replace the re-circulation pump if needed during your water heater replacement. If you depend on electricity to heat your water, you have another choice that's better than a conventional tank or a tankless water heater.

<p>The evacuated tube collector solar powered heater is an alternate type of solar water heater, smaller and deemed more efficient, also roof mounted, is said to work very well in cold climates. If you know how to flush a water heater and perform the steps once a year as well as maintain the unit according to any other manufacturer's recommendations, you can get several more years, but the tank will still fail eventually.</p>

Everyone is talking about on demand” these days, but the buzz has moved well beyond movies and videos and into the world of plumbing with the increasing popularity of tankless water heaters. The heater will proceed to release water into the container. Another benefit of tankless water heaters is that they last about 5-10 years longer than traditional systems before requiring replacement.</p>
