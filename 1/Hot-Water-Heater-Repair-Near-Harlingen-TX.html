<h2>Water Heater Services Harlingen Texas</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Your contractor does not require any special training or previous experience with tankless water heaters. Installing a tankless water heater is a greater upfront investment, but these units can significantly cut the cost of monthly utilities.

<p>Compact tankless water heaters only heat water when you need it. This type of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water on demand. Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>

Once our plumbers determine the fuel source in your home, they can start narrowing down the water heater selection.</p>
<p>If your water heater is around 10 years old and it's got a major mechanical problem, replacement is usually your best option. Your tankless water heater can provide you with endless hot water for years to come with the right repair and maintenance from Central Plumbing.

<p>Depending on your tankless water heater's capacity, too many simultaneous hot water applications (such as multiple showers running) can overload your water heater. Yes, one of the main reasons we get called out to a customer's house is their water heater has broken down and isn't supplying hot water anymore. This isn't an issue with tankless water heaters.
