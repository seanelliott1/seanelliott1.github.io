<h2>Water Heater Services Justin Texas</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

<p>Failed heating elements, faulty water heater thermostats, or discolored water all indicate a problem with your water heater.

In between the inside tank and the outer shell is often insulation to help keep the water hot, without the elements having to do all of the work. High efficiency water heaters from Navien deliver endless, on-demand hot water at one or more places in your home.</p>
