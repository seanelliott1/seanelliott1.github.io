<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>That means we know how to quickly and reliably provide tankless water heater repair service no matter what type of problem your hot water heater has. We can also recommend a preventive maintenance plan that will keep your water heater in working order. As the water flows across the heating elements, it gets hot. Age is the most common reason your water heater will need to be replaced, though consistent problems with leaks and sediment build-up may require more than just repairs.</p>
<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss. To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
