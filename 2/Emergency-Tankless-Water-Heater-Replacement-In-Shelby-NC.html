The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot. Most property owners don't think about replacing water heaters until it's a need. For example, many homes, regardless of the type of fuel source used to heat hot water tanks now require a 4” exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>Energy efficiencies between the different types of burners on the tank water heaters can differ greatly. Traditional water heaters cost less than tankless or heat pump water heaters - it's one reason why they're the most popular choice among Atlanta homeowners.
