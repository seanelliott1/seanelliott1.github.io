<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap.

<p>A gas water heater can be used even during power outages, and are usually more ideal for a large family, as they have a fast recovery time. While these are cost-efficient at first buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable way for you to receive hot water, especially if your unit is outdated. One of the most important ways to maintain the functionality of a tank-type water heater is to flush the tank.
