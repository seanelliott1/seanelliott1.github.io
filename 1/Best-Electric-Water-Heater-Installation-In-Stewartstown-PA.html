<p>Water heaters can run into several problems if not maintained properly. We provide prompt, reliable repairs and service. Because of their high-powered burners, tankless heaters need to be installed in a well-vented space for safe operation. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is always ready.

Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car.

<p>Tankless: Tankless water heaters tend to cost more up front than storage tank models. Hot water heaters come in all shapes and sizes, some fueled by natural gas or oil, some by electricity or propane. If these tanks are replaced with tankless hot water heaters, newfound space can be converted into another resident amenity, such as on-site storage or laundry, both of which can bring in extra revenue. Most heaters are not sold with these jackets in place so a lot of heat can be lost through the tanks body.</p>

<p>Turn off the water and gas or electric before you begin, and take particular care to vent gas models properly.

With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>
<p>If you are operating a shower at 2.5 GPM and a dishwasher at 2 GPM during peak usage, you home would require a whole-home tankless gas water heater that is rated for minimum of 4.5 GPM at a 65° F temperature rise. When it's near the points of use, the time taken by the hot water to travel from the heater to the fixture will reduce. We offer water heater repair services throughout the Orange County area. Your home's water system is much more complicated than you probably think, involving several separate plumbing systems all working together to provide you with functional service and comfort.</p>

We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Stewartstown Pennsylvania 17363</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>

With tankless heaters you have the benefit of an endless supply of hot water. A tankless water heater is less likely to corrode than a storage tank system, but if the pipes start to leak, corrosion can start up. If the corrosion develops too far, the whole system may need to be replaced.</p>
<p>Working with gas heater installations has its own dangers that can lead to deadly explosions or fatal exposure to noxious gases. Any time you're dealing with natural gas or electricity especially around water, you'll want to have the job done the right way by someone who knows what he or she is doing. However, if you don't have a large family, you may benefit from the cost savings of a tankless water heater. Space: In smaller homes or condos, tankless units are ideal because they take up less space than traditional units.</p>
<p>Calculating an everyday tank water heater can be easier than a tankless water heater. This contractor will check out your water heater, maintain its performance or fix any problems with it. Furthermore, they also know how to take out faulty parts and replace them with new ones.
