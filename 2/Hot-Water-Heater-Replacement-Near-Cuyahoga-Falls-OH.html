<h2>Water Heater Services Cuyahoga Falls Ohio</h2>
<p>More and more people are choosing an electric tankless hot water heater over its gas and propane counterparts. No matter your brand of water heater, or if it's gas or electric, our skilled team can handle your repair effectively and affordably. Whether it be in your commercial business or your home, water heaters are vital across the board. Tankless water heaters are a compact, efficient way to supply hot water to your home. Sediment build-up can also cause your water heating element to short circuit, leading to complete failure.</p>
<p>Since a tankless unit only runs when hot water is being used, it can be left on with no waste or risk and no worries. A tankless water heater will last about twenty(20) years, while a conventional water heater may only last ten(10) to thirteen(13) years or less (depending on the quality of your water). He quickly identified the issue (lower heating element not working) and explained the situation (very old water heater) and my options to address in a very easy to understand manner.</p>
<p>This replaces the endless heating and cooling of gallons of water that a conventional tank water heater does throughout the day, which saves you from high energy costs and needing to limit how many people can shower at one time. For this reason, tankless systems are also called on-demand water heaters. At Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc.

<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Cuyahoga Falls</h3>
<p>The two most important areas you have to focus on when installing a tankless water heater are making sure you have the right size fittings and that you have a proper ventilation system set up for the unit. If you live in an area such as Dallas, with hard water, then be sure to call an experienced licensed Dallas plumber to thoroughly check your water heater on a regular basis. A basic solar water heater system can cost $1,000-$4,000 to install, minus possible tax credits of up to 30% off the cost.</p>
<p>If the temperature sensor (9) detects that the water exceeds or falls short of the desired setting, the panel will adjust the gas valve, the mixing valve, and the flow-regulating water valve (10) accordingly. Water heater problems are a good example of when this choice is important. Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
<p>Most of the time, if you are not getting hot water, it is because the pilot light on your water heater is out. It is recommended that you hire a licensed, professional to install your water heater. We are the leading water heaters company in the region and are known for providing prompt and high quality gas & electric water heater repair services. Hot water heater replacement shouldn't be a gamble for your family.</p>

Simply go to your water heater, check the temperature dial, and make sure it is set in between 115 to 120 degrees F (or 46 degrees to 49 degrees C). Lowering the setting will prevent the tank from overheating, which reduces energy bills drastically.</p>
