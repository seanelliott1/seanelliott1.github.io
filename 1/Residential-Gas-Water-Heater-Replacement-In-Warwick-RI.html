The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank.

Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
