<p>Water heater maintenance is one of the most important yet overlooked things home owners need to be aware of. Whether residing in a fairly new or older dwelling, it is very important that you inspect the appliance at regular intervals and make sure that it is working properly. You generally have to install a tank water heater indoors, as they cannot tolerate harsh weather conditions. There are several ways that you can benefit from having a tankless water heater installed.

<p>If the water heater is too small, it will not provide enough hot water, and it will continuously run to create more hot water, which can cause the heater to fail prematurely and increase your energy bills. In order to check or replace a water heater element you will have to turn off the breaker serving the water heater circuit and remove the access cover on the water heater. A unit that requires cleaning, maintenance, or repair will struggle to meet your hot water demands.</p>

Because of this, they have proven to be more energy efficient compared to traditional tank units.
