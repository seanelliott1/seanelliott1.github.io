Lee's provides a wide range of water heaters for installation, but if you're concerned with energy-efficiency, then a tankless water heater (also known as on-demand water heaters) may be just right for you. Our courteous professionals can help you determine what is right for your budget, home, and lifestyle as you look at different water heaters. Tanks of some storage water heater types are heavily insulated, which substantially reduces standby heat losses and cuts annual operating costs.</p>

If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
