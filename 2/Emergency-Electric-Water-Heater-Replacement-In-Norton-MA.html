<h2>Water Heater Services Norton Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>Highly efficient water heaters such as tankless coil and indirect ones use less energy than conventional units, saving homeowners money on their utility bills in the long run. Hot water can add up to 25% of your energy bill, so be sure to choose an energy efficient heating appliance. These signs could mean that it's time to look into water heater repair. While a tankless water heater can provide an unlimited amount of hot water, it can only provide a limited volume.</p>
<p>Gas fittings and electrical connections age and wear out over time as well, all of which can lead to the decision to replace your current water heater. Water heaters that have not been properly installed and inspected can become a fire, explosion and health hazard for your building and occupants. Once we find the issue with your water heater we will be able to repair it then and there. This is because instead of wasting energy keep water warm in a tank, a tankless water heater only heats water as you use it.</p>
