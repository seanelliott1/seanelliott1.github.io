<h2>Water Heater Services Galena Park Texas</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>The water heater anode rod will become caked with contaminants over time, which will cause the rod to be eaten away and eventually need to be replaced, but this component is very inexpensive when compared to the cost of a new water heater. Our technicians can recommend the proper repairs or water heater replacement if necessary. Fast, efficient, and always with the highest quality service, depend on us to fix your geyser and heater any time of the day, any time of the year.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Galena Park</h3>
<p>When your water heater fails, a brand new water heater may be called for, especially if your existing unit is very old. Call Epic Plumbing at (281) 815-2322 to schedule an appointment for professional tankless water heater repair and installation services in Pearland. Yes, some problems with water heaters can be repaired but not all. This cuts down on the water heater's efficiency and its ability to adequately heat the water.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
<p>If your heater is approaching old age, replacement may be smarter than repair. They can supply endless hot water because they begin heating water as soon as a faucet is turned on. So, unlike tank heaters, users never have to wait for a massive tank of water to heat up between uses. The Hot Water Heater Company is your local expert for installing, repairing or replacing hot water heaters. From installations to repairs and replacements, you can get the full Mitchell Heating experience by reaching out to our friendly staff today.</p>
<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Galena Park TX</h3>
<p>Tankless electric units emit zero greenhouse gasses and are 20%-30% more efficient than ones with a tank. Homeowners who are asking themselves are tankless water heaters worth it will find that the answer depends on where they live, the prices for installation in their area, and the way in which their household uses hot water. When we think of water heater temperature problems, our minds usually jump to the scenario of having no hot water.</p>
<p>This soon eats up a lot of energy and eventually raises your electric and gas bills. Poorly installed electric wires can suddenly overheat and burn down your home. There is most likely a malfunction in your water heater and a replacement should be considered. There's no reason not to. You may think that because you live in an area that is generally colder and overcast much of the time that you cant use a solar hot water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>

<p>We Also Offer Tankless Water Heater Installation Service. The water is heated by using electricity, gas, or propane as the heat source, and sometimes it can reduce your electric bill by as much as 10 to 20 percent. Heat pumps also have heating elements like conventional water heaters that turn on if the unit can't generate enough hot water on its own,” says Banta. As a locally owned and operated company, we understand the unique plumbing, heating, and AC needs of our neighbors and can provide the most cost-effective solution.</p>
<p>The installation of a water heater depends on the selected system. I highly recommend Epic for any plumbing or hot water repairs you might need. Whether you are in need of a professional plumber for drain cleaning, sewer leaks, or water heater repair or a heating and cooling technician for your central heating and cooling you can count on us. We are the go to source for plumbing and heating and cooling repairs, installation and maintenance.</p>
<p>In your specific case, this may require a larger gas line or a much larger electric supply than what is currently running to your water heater location. Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service. If you're not getting hot water, it could be the heating element or another maintenance issue. Whether you have a gas, propane, or electric water heater, there might be times when you wish you had more hot water to work with.</p>
<p>If your water heater is in a location that will not cause damage if there is a leak, you can wait until it develops a leak before replacing it, but that really is not recommended. The amount you pay for service goes towards your replacement. In addition, we are trained to repair and install commercial tankless water heater and commercial water heater systems. Luckily, hot water heaters are fairly simple and don't have a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater does not heat and re-heat the same water in the tank, saving you money. Noise - water heaters collect mineral deposits and sediment on the heating elements, just at the bottom of the tank. Enjoy having steady hot water again and call Trusted Plumbing. Thus the best option would be to invite a qualified plumbing and heating contractor to install your water heater like the one from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning.</p>
