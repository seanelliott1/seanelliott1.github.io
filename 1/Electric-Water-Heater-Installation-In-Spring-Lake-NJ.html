<h2>Water Heater Services Spring Lake New Jersey</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade.

Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
