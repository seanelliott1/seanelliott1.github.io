Over time, even well-maintained water heaters will begin to lose efficiency and develop more problems associated with wear and tear.</p>
<p>If you can't confidently say you know how to install a water heater you really need to use caution. As opposed to waiting for a storage tank to fill with enough hot water for use, tankless water heaters provide a constant supply of it.
