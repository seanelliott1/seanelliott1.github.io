Replace your standard water heater with an electric fired tankless water heater. Normally, gas-type water heater last up to 12 years.

<p>Using a heating element, either electric or gas-powered, water passes into the unit and is immediately warmed to a set temperature. You will soon hear banging or rumbling sounds from your heater due to the obstruction inside the tank. New home construction is the best time to think about energy saving appliances like tankless hot water heaters, especially for gas heaters that require more home modification.</p>
<p>Compare this to a traditional water heater tank, which usually only gets 7-10 years of life before it needs to be replaced. Many utility companies offer rebates on certain models of water heaters, generally those certified as low energy utilizing models. Tankless water heaters that use natural gas are about 23 percent more efficient than a traditional storage version, which is about 60 percent efficient, according to the Department of Energy.</p>

Licensed plumbers know how to install a gas water heater without creating a potentially dangerous situation (and how to install electric water heater without getting electrocuted in the process).

Condensing water heaters have a tank like a conventional storage tank water heater, but they capture hot exhaust gases that would normally be expelled from a home out the flue.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired.
