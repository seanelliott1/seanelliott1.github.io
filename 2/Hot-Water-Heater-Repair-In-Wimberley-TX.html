Whether it be in your commercial business or your home, water heaters are vital across the board. Tankless water heaters are a compact, efficient way to supply hot water to your home.

Changing to a tankless system like the Tempra® eliminates these problems and results in typical savings of at least 15 - 20% on the hot water portion of your electric bill. Never attempt to do it without first reading all the instructions that can with your particular tankless water heater. While you can help prolong the life of your water heater with annual maintenance, chances are you'll need to have the pre-existing tank replaced with a new one if you occupy a given residence for more than eight years.</p>

<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

<p>This makes tankless water heaters take longer to deliver hot water. Although hot water heaters can differ from model to model, they all operate on similar ideas. There should be a large circular opening near the bottom of the heater to attach the new temperature and pressure relief valve to. If you don't see one, consult the manufacturer's guide. They can range from the usual water heaters that simply store a tank of hot water for the household's use.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that there have been code changes and other requirements that may apply to the replacement of an existing water heater. First, turn the gas control knob on the water heater to "pilot, " then remove the metal plate and look to see if the pilot is lit. In most cases, you will not need to replace the heater, just repair or replace the parts. Professional installation avoids the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning, explosions, or fire with proper venting, gas lines, and wiring.</p>
<p>Once the heating elements fry, it usually costs about as much to replace the entire heater as it does to swap in new elements. Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
<p>A gas water heater can be used even during power outages, and are usually more ideal for a large family, as they have a fast recovery time. While these are cost-efficient at first buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable way for you to receive hot water, especially if your unit is outdated. One of the most important ways to maintain the functionality of a tank-type water heater is to flush the tank. We are able to install gas and electric water heaters, as well as tank and tankless water heaters.</p>
