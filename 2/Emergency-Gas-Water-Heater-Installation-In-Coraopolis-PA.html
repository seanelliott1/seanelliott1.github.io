<h2>Water Heater Services Coraopolis Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Your water heater is one of the single most expensive components of your plumbing system.

We will show you the potential causes and after you enter your model number into the search field, we'll sell you the exact part that fits your water heater and show you how to install it. Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater.

Storage water heaters are the large, familiar white tall, cylindrical tanks. After attempting reset, check the heating element for power again. Another pipe that emerges from the tank includes the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you exceed a preset level. The biggest residential electric tankless can deliver less than 5 GPM at a realistic temperature rise.</p>
