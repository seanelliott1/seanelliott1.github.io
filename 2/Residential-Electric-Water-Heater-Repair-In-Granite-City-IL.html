<h2>Water Heater Services Granite City Illinois</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters. By periodically draining the water heater tank and having a thorough rinse performed by our professionals, you'll be able to keep mineral buildup to a minimum. Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Installation Granite City</h3>
<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are a relatively new entrant into the market, but they work quite well for most homeowners. This is true, but, like all man made things, at times, the heater might simply refuse to supply hot water. More Hot Water: Newer water heaters are able to provide you with more hot water. Check the literature for the brand heater you are considering and find the output in gallons per minute (GPM) at the temperature rise you need.</p>

Once repaired, you may want to consider a maintenance plan on your hot water heater to make sure that you do not have future issues. Because of the demands of larger households, it might make sense to install one or more additional tankless units. The computer pulls in gas and ignites a fire within the contained burner, which provides heat to the heat exchanger The incoming water is then circulated through the activated heat exchanger, heating the water to the temperature set on the thermostat before leaving the system through the hot water outlet pipe where it is directed to the appropriate faucet or appliance.</p>

A conventional water heater is a large, cylindrical tank with a heat exchanger inside.

<p>Tankless, or on-demand water heaters are growing in popularity, largely due to their ability to produce an endless supply of hot water, despite the amount of usage.
