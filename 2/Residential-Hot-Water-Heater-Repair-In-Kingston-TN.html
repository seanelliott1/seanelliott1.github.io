<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater.

<p>The new line of A. Smith electric tankless water heaters provide an energy efficient and easy-to-install solution for your home or business. Whether you have an electric or gas water heater, it needs something to cycle the heat on and off. This means that water heaters should be set above 115 degrees in order to prevent the build-up of the bacteria in the system.

<p>Tankless electric units emit zero greenhouse gasses and are 20%-30% more efficient than ones with a tank. Homeowners who are asking themselves are tankless water heaters worth it will find that the answer depends on where they live, the prices for installation in their area, and the way in which their household uses hot water. When we think of water heater temperature problems, our minds usually jump to the scenario of having no hot water.</p>

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
<p>Water heater is making noise - Rumbling, banging, knocking or popping noises coming from your water heater are due to accumulated sediment that settles and hardens at the bottom of your tank as it is continually exposed to heat. Know what conditions require emergency water heater repair and what can wait for a scheduled appointment. Before you get a new water heater, you'll want to determine which system best matches your household's needs.</p>

<p>Gas units just heat water faster than electric, tankless or otherwise. A traditional water heater has an average lifespan of 10 to 15 years, but they can fail without warning. When it comes to quality, Noritz takes no short cuts in producing the highest quality tankless water heaters. A properly installed and insulated conventional water heater will save you money on your energy bills without requiring any modifications to your existing ventilation, power supply, or gas supply.</p>
<p>Gas units are available in a large variety of models and sizes for both home and commercial use and range in output from 130,000 to 380,000 BTUs. Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
