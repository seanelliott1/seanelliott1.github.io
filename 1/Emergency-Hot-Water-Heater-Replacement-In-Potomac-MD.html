<h2>Water Heater Services Potomac Maryland</h2>
<p>Water is dripping constantly from the rag that you have wrapped around the pin hole in the water pipe. Install an additional tankless water heater to ensure you can always meet demand. Once your water heater stops working, you should know what to do, whether to apply a DIY approach or to go on and call a plumber. When you open a faucet, the released hot water is replaced by incoming cold water, which is heated and stored again at a temperature controlled by one or more thermostats in the tank. Having hot water and heat for your home is a must have.</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
<p>And obviously, tankless water heaters take up much less space than the hulking behemoth of an old fashioned storage water heater. Our water heater repair will fix problems with any make and type of burners and other heating parts. Request us today for a free estimate on installing a new unit. Environmentally Friendly: Improved efficiency also leads to a reduced carbon footprint, making a tankless water heater installation a great move to make your home greener.</p>

<p>There are several different kinds of hot water heaters that come from numerous different companies. Worse, you're probably already aware how deadly gas leaks can be.

For many people, having to repair their water heater is an issue that will sneak up on them.</p>
<p>On a gas unit, also shut off the gas and unplug the electrical supply or turn off the circuit breaker.

Flow rate: Flow rate refers to how many gallons of hot water the unit can provide in a minute. We will help you choose a water heater that is more energy-efficient and one that will work for your specific water needs.</p>

If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time. The only way to know if your current hot w. heater is collecting minerals and deposits is to call a qualified plumber and have them come out and inspect your w. heater.</p>
