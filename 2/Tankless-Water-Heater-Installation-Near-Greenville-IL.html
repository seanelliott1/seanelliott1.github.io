We will make sure you get the best water heater solution for your needs, we will handle all aspects of the installation, and we will remove your old water heater. We can provide regular maintenance, repairs, and replacements to help increase the life of your water heater. Especially if you choose a model with a large tank, your energy bills can really add up over time.</p>
<p>This is a type of heater that provides hot water only as it is needed. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat. Tankless gas models need to produce very high combustion temperatures so that they can instantaneously raise the temperature of incoming cold water to the desired temperature.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Greenville</h3>
<p>Our Professionals will Evaluate the water heater and determine whether a repair is warranted or replacement is necessary sharing finding with you. Then we professionally install your new, energy-efficient water heater. An oversized hot water tank is a waste of money. If you are thinking about replacing your gas fired hot water heater or just need it serviced, give us a call. It also can be used with combination water and space heating systems, which include tankless coil and indirect water heaters.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day.

Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>

<p>We are trained and equipped to repair and maintain all makes and models of water heaters. However, if you prefer to install your new water heater DIY-style, be prepared to spend a couple of hours in order to finish the whole setup.

<p>Our tankless and tank water heater technicians are ready to diagnose your water heater issue and repair the issue.

Tankless water heaters are far more efficient because they do not waste energy keeping water hot when there is no demand for it. Maintaining the temperature of a 50-gallon tank of water takes a lot of gas or electricity that is not needed with the in-demand style of water heaters.</p>

<p>When installing an exterior model you need to insulate the pipelines. A direct vent water heater is basically a sealed unit that has either two pipes or a concentric pipe pipe within pipe to suck in fresh air from outside the bathroom and also dispense exhaust gases outside. Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
