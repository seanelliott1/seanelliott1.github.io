Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank. Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life.
