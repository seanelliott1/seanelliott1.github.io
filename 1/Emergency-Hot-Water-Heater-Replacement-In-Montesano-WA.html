<h2>Water Heater Services Montesano Washington</h2>
<p>Let's face it, unless you have invested in the new state-of-the-art tankless systems, water heaters take up a lot of space. The less water you use, the more efficient your tankless water heater will be. That's why these systems are ideal for vacation homes and families that use less water. Replaced 75 gallon electric water heater with rheem 75 gallon Marathon with a lifetime warranty. Most homeowners don't give much thought to the water heater until it goes out. Age - The serial number on the water heater should also contain the date of manufacture, which will give you the heater's age.</p>
<p>The Energy Factor (EF) rating on the label will tell you have efficient the hot water heater is at transferring heat from the energy source to the water. If you feel warmth, your water heater is probably working. If your heater is electric or gas, we will talk you through our tankless water heater installation.

However, if your water looks rusty, has a funky smell, or produces a strange noise, it's time to call a professional for a hot water heater repair.

Also, because they are not heating 40 - 50 gallons of water 24 hours a day, tankless water heaters are less susceptible to leakage than tank-type water heaters. Homeowners believing they now had cheap hot water tended to use a lot more water than before the solar heaters were installed.</p>
<p>Tankless electric units have shorter life spans, on the order of 7 to 10 years. Your vent is undersized at 3”. This application requires a short water heater, a minimum of a 12” connector rise, 4” vent, and a new gas cock. Instead, why not turn to the new technology that has been around for 50 years - tankless water heaters. For larger households that use more than 86 gallons of hot water each day, tankless systems can be up to 14% more energy efficient than traditional water heaters.</p>
