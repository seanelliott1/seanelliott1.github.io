Age - The serial number on the water heater should also contain the date of manufacture, which will give you the heater's age.</p>

<p>This helps ensure that your new hot water heater is installed properly and will provide you and your residents and employees with years of hot water.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Ellisville</h3>
<p>Avoid ice cold showers and keep your water heater functioning properly. We have a variety of options for you including high-efficiency water heaters, electric water heaters, gas water heaters and tankless water heaters. Heaters produce heat, and that heat can cause a fire if not handled properly. Tankless water heaters provide hot water on demand, so regardless of household usage, you save money, energy and reduce waste by only heating water when you need it.</p>
<p>John Wood has models to suit every size of home and hot water demand. Installing an instant hot water heater requires careful attention to plumbing and electrical connections to ensure proper appliance functioning. Once you have decided on a power source for your tankless water heater your next step is to determine which brand you would prefer. If you run into the decision of whether to repair or replace your water heater, a good guideline to follow is to never spend more than half the cost of replacing a water heater on the repair.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: When properly maintained each year, a tankless water heater can potentially last multiple decades before replacement. 2. As mentioned earlier, you have to check the type of water heater you have. That's where WeatherMakers comes in.

<p>Storage water heaters lose heat and can cost a lot of money in maintenance over time. The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>
<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Ellisville MS</h3>
<p>Petersen Plumbing does not recommend tankless water heaters in locations with hard well water, or where galvanized steel pipe is present either in the building, or in the water service to the building. Capacity: The size of on-demand water heaters should be based on the number of occupants in the home and their peak hour water demand, rather than the size of the house. Units that undergo routine checks and upgrades last longer and undergo less frequent and costly repairs.</p>
<p>This includes inspecting the pressure relief valve, burner assembly, filters, anode rod and power supply that's heating the water. An electric water heater could easily short out, causing more damage to the heater or leave you in a dangerous situation. If your hot water heater is not working, it can be tough to go about your daily routine. These details are important and easy to get to. To find the capacity of the tankless hot water heater you need, you first have to find two numbers, which are plotted in a chart on the manufacture's site.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble with your existing water heater, schedule an in-home consultation and let one of our professional, licensed technicians inspect your unit. Tankless water heaters are far more efficient because they do not waste energy keeping water hot when there is no demand for it. Maintaining the temperature of a 50-gallon tank of water takes a lot of gas or electricity that is not needed with the in-demand style of water heaters.</p>
