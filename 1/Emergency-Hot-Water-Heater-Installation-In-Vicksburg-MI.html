When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution.

<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
