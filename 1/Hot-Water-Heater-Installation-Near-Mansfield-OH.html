If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
