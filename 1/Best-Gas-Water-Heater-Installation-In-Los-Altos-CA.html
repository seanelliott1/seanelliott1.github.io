<h2>Water Heater Services Los Altos California</h2>
<p>No matter how careful we are with our things, there comes a time when we need to replace them. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a bit more than a traditional storage tank water heater, but, tankless varieties last longer than conventional water heater models which translates to a 20+-year useful life, as compared to storage tank types which last only 10 to 15 years before self-destructing, possibly flooding your basement or home, depending on their location If you want to hit a home run,” install a tankless water heater at each hot water outlet.</p>
<p>The recommended water heater setting of about 115-120 degrees, it keeps your water heater from overheating and save a lot of electricity. Trying to install a water heater yourself can be dangerous and end up costing more than hiring a professional. All forms of flammable material must be kept far away from the heater, while construction components hidden in the wall like wooden supports must be properly insulated from heat in order not to weaken or even ignite as the heater is used over time.</p>
<p>Get estimates for how much it will cost to update your home's current venting as well as its current electrical system or gas fittings. Today's plumbing code requires all tank-style water heaters to have a temperature and pressure relief valve that opens to release pressure and eliminate the possibility of the tank exploding. Traditional water heaters are easier and less costly to install, but they do cost more to run.</p>
<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Replacement Los Altos</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank. A water heater expansion tank is a must if your home runs on a closed water supply system. Water heater repair is what is required, hence get in touch with a plumber. After paying another plumbing company $70.00 to give me a crazy estimate of $2,500 to replace my water heater, I began calling other plumbers asking for a free estimate.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>You'll need to find out how to dispose of your old water heater and check out the local codes for disposal. In this example, the whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly $1000 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over a 15 year time period. If you install a tankless hot water heater that is too small, your hot water flow can decrease when multiple plumbing fixtures are turned on simultaneously.</p>

<p>The average cost for a tankless water heater installation is $1,985, or between $1,470-$2,510. Tankless water heaters produce an endless supply of hot water, take up less space, have a lower risk of leaking, are safer, and have a significantly longer lifespan on average.
