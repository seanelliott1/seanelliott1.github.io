<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy. The tanklees electric water heater heats the water immediately when it is turned on. There is a heating element, or several heating elements, in the pipe and as the water flows over them, it gets heated up. These appliances are easy to install, provide great value, require less maintenance and offer every member of the family an unlimited supply of instant hot water.</p>
<p>If the heating elements are good, the problem could be with the thermostats or cutoff switch. A traditional hot water heater typically holds 40-60 gallons of water that is collected in a tank and then continuously heated until it's needed.
