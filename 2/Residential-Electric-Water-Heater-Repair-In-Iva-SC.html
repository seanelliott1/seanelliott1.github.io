<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Iva SC</h3>
<p>To keep your tankless water heater running like new, you can do a few things yourself - like cleaning the air and in-line water filters - but an annual maintenance service visit is highly recommended. Depending on where you live, there may be one or more thermostats to deliver the best comfort; one to control the tubing water supply temperature, one to control different zones throughout the home, and one for outside the home.</p>
<p>If your local water's hardness exceeds 8 grains per gallon, you may need to install a water filter prior to installing the water heater.

Even if your current water heater is traditional, tankless, or electric or gas-powered, you can always add a single-point electric tankless unit under a sink or in a new bathroom as demand increases in your home.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>
