<p>As you may know, there are three varieties of water heaters: tank less or instant, solar and the tank or the storage. I called several places about the water heater, and they said it would cost me over $1,000. Even though the water heater does show any signs of failure, it needs to be checked regularly to avoid any expensive repairs in the future. Mallick Plumbing & Heating is the Service Contractor of Choice in Silver Spring, MD and throughout Montgomery County. Storage tank water heaters have lower initial cost by a significant margin.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
<p>Our technicians are experienced enough to handle all brands and models of water heaters such as Racold, Venus, etc. Relying on your plumber's hot water heater system replacement recommendation may not be the best choice for you or your hot water system installation.

If the extra costs of installing a tankless system are going to outweigh your potential savings, you may want to consider a tank system or a high-efficiency tank system.
