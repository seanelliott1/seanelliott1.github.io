<p>Hot water system replacement cost will vary with the complexity of the hot water system replacement. This will also cause the water heater to work harder to heat the remaining water inside the tank because it is losing hot water through the leak.

Because water heaters can leak and flood homes, it is vital to have your water heater examined as soon as you notice a problem.

<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
