<h2>Water Heater Services King George Virginia</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>The recommended water heater setting of about 115-120 degrees, it keeps your water heater from overheating and save a lot of electricity. Trying to install a water heater yourself can be dangerous and end up costing more than hiring a professional. All forms of flammable material must be kept far away from the heater, while construction components hidden in the wall like wooden supports must be properly insulated from heat in order not to weaken or even ignite as the heater is used over time.</p>
<p>Gas fittings and electrical connections age and wear out over time as well, all of which can lead to the decision to replace your current water heater. Water heaters that have not been properly installed and inspected can become a fire, explosion and health hazard for your building and occupants. Once we find the issue with your water heater we will be able to repair it then and there. This is because instead of wasting energy keep water warm in a tank, a tankless water heater only heats water as you use it.</p>

You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>The most cost effective way to replace a water heater is to replace like for like. That's the equivalent of taking several showers, running the dishwasher, washing one load of laundry, and turning the faucet on and off multiple times,” says John Banta, an engineer who oversees our water heater tests.
