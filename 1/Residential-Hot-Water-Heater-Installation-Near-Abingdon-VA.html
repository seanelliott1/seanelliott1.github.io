<h2>Water Heater Services Abingdon Virginia</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>One of the things to consider when planning a water heater installation project is the installation cost. Press the black probe firmly against the metal tank or the heating element mounting nuts or screws (not the other terminal screw). There are some elements that set each type of water heater a apart from one another. If your old water heater used copper piping, you may choose to plumb it with copper piping again.</p>
