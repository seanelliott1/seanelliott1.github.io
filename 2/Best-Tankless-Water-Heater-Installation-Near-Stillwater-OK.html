<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>

Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water every day, according to They also last about twice as long as a tank water heater.</p>
