<p>Of course, the TP valve or pipe could still be warm if the water heater stopped working within the last 3 or 4 hours because the water inside would still be holding some heat. Tankless heaters are much more expensive than ordinary water heating systems. Regardless of the type of water heater that is in your home, it is an inevitability that you will experience some kind of issues with it. Usually, this is in the form of no hot water coming out of your faucets or shower.</p>

So that increases the installation cost even further. If you flush your tank heater annually and call for professional service when you experience any operational issues, you will ensure your heater the maximum lifespan. High Energy Bills: Your water heater, particularly if you have a traditional tanked unit, is one of the highest consumers of electricity.</p>
