<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>Although tankless water heaters cost a little more to install initially than regular tank systems , you'll find you'll begin to save in the long term. We have been so long in this business that we have witnessed the introduction of the first tankless water heater models in Dallas.

<p>Gas units are available in a large variety of models and sizes for both home and commercial use and range in output from 130,000 to 380,000 BTUs. Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
