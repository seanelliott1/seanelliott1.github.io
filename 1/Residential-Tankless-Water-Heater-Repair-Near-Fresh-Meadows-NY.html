<h2>Water Heater Services Fresh Meadows New York</h2>

Are similar to conventional units in that they both burn gas, exhaust flues and store hot water in an insulated tank. However, from time to time, something can happen which will require you to have to look for a quality water heater repair service.</p>

<p>Solar water heaters are efficient but expensive. If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced.

Since tankless models heat water on demand, they usually end up heating a lower volume of water for less time when compared to conventional water heaters.</p>

It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
