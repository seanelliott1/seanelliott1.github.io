For this reason, you need a repair expert who is experienced in handling tankless style heaters, and that's exactly what HomeWorks water heater repair technicians can offer you. Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>

<p>You can also use a tankless hot water system which effectively only heats the water that you need when you need it. This certifies that the water is not always heated multiple times inside the big tank. These layers make the tank use more energy to heat up, causing the unit to overheat and weaken. When this happens, the pressure inside your water heater will build up and an explosion will occur.

<p>In your specific case, this may require a larger gas line or a much larger electric supply than what is currently running to your water heater location. Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service.

<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Compare the water heater's STCs for Zone 3 and for Zone 4 with the minimum requirements. Tankless water heaters last an average of 5-10 years longer than tank heaters. Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
