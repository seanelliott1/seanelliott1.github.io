<p>As you may know, there are three varieties of water heaters: tank less or instant, solar and the tank or the storage. I called several places about the water heater, and they said it would cost me over $1,000.

The water heater tank is damaged or rusted. One of the most vital plumbing components in your home is the water heater. You need someone you can rely on when you say, Fix my water heater!” At Davis Home Services, that's the type of service we want to give you every time.</p>
