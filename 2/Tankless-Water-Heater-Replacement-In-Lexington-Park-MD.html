<h2>Water Heater Services Lexington Park Maryland</h2>
<p>A tankless gas hot water heater can be complicated when it comes to piping and venting requirements. In addition, many state and local utilities offer rebates and incentives for converting to energy-saving appliances, which can help mitigate the cost of installing a tankless system. The payoff is big — you'll save up to 60% of the water heater part of your electric bill. If your water heater needs to be repaired periodically, then a decision to replace it needs to be taken. When the water on the top of the tank is hot, the top element turns off and the lower one heats.</p>
<p>In third place is the gas-powered tankless water heater. Water, not warming enough is one of the most straightforward sign you will receive from your instant water heater if something is wrong. And electric tankless models draw so much power—120 to 160 amps—that you may have to upgrade the electrical service to your house to 200 amps or more. In most cases, a person is going to notice that there are small signs that the water heater is getting ready to fail before it completely quits.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with. It is important to know what you have as well as the benefits and disadvantages to making water heater changes, which is why our friendly technicians are here to help.</p>

<p>The following guide explains how to install an electric tankless water heater step by step. These units heat faster and are more economical than standard electric models. Simply go to your water heater, check the temperature dial, and make sure it is set in between 115 to 120 degrees F (or 46 degrees to 49 degrees C). Lowering the setting will prevent the tank from overheating, which reduces energy bills drastically.</p>
