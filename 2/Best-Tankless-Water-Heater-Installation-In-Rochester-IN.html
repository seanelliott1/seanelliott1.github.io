Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>

Safety - With tankless water heaters there is virtually no chance of your child or anyone else being scalded by hot water out of the tap. There are some common mistakes that homeowners make with their water heaters that should be avoided. If the tankless water heater doesn't properly vent out exhaust gases from the heat exchanger, it can cause the heat exchanger to corrode, and this can be potentially harmful to your house.</p>
<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss. To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
