<p>Compact tankless water heaters only heat water when you need it. This type of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water on demand. Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>
<p>Depending on your household size and personal energy-saving goals, a tankless water heater may be right for you. It is never recommended that you attempt to replace a gas or electric water heater if you are not specifically trained to do so. Improper installation of water heaters may cause fire or explosion. Knowing when your tankless water heater is malfunctioning or damaged will give you the knowledge to call for repairs at the right time.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters supply hot water when you need it without the use of a storage tank. The main differences include that a direct vent heater uses an inducer motor to boost the removal of exhaust gas and can be vented with PVC pipe. Internal corrosions is most likely occurring in your water heater and it's time to consider replacing it with a more efficient, modern model. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>If your water heater does not have a flue, then it is an electric water heater with a 240-volt supply (see the images in Figure 1 ).

If the water heater liner corrodes, the unit can start leaking—and if the drain pan under the water heater is old or incorrectly installed, you may end up with water damage to your floors, ceilings or wall, depending on the location of your appliance.</p>
<p>Compare the water heater's STCs for Zone 3 and for Zone 4 with the minimum requirements. Tankless water heaters last an average of 5-10 years longer than tank heaters. Tank water heaters store water and heat it on demand, while tankless water heaters heat the water using coils, without storing it. Tank water heaters are generally less expensive and can accommodate high-demand households, while tankless are more expensive up front, but can reduce your energy usage by around 30 per cent.</p>
