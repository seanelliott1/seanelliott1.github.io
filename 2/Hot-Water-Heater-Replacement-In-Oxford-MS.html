<h2>Water Heater Services Oxford Mississippi</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>

We will make sure you get the best water heater solution for your needs, we will handle all aspects of the installation, and we will remove your old water heater. We can provide regular maintenance, repairs, and replacements to help increase the life of your water heater. Especially if you choose a model with a large tank, your energy bills can really add up over time.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker. Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>

In most cases, people who get combination space and water heating systems are doing new construction, but you can also retrofit these units with existing sources for heating water.</p>
<p>It'll take about 20 to 30 minutes to completely drain a 40 gallon water heater. Keep in mind that the tank size you need should be based on the maximum amount of hot water you will need during busy times, not on the storage room available for it. In some cases, you may have to switch to an outdoor model is the size you need can't be accommodated in the space available inside your home. There are several different factors worth considering before purchasing a new water heater.</p>
<p>Whether you need scheduled maintenance or emergency water heater repair, Brown's Heating, Cooling & Plumbing has the trained plumbing technicians ready to assist you. A Direct Vent water heater is similar to a standard water heater in configuration. Self-cleaning units automatically fight lime and sediment buildup to lengthen tank life and maintain peak efficiency for a longer period. Although flushing your water heater storage tank and replacing the sacrificial anode rod are ways to actively maintain your water heater, improving the quality of water within your home is a way to passively maintain your water heater.</p>
<p>The average cost for a plumber to install a water heater is about $80 per hour. If the sacrificial anode rod is not replaced once it has been fully corroded, your hot water storage tank will begin to corrode, meaning you will probably have to replace it prematurely. One or both heating elements may have burned out and need replacing. When purchased from a Rinnai® authorized dealer and installed by a licensed installation professional, your Rinnai® tankless water heater comes with a generous warranty to give you even more peace of mind.</p>

However, tankless water heaters are becoming standard in new developments, so if you live in a newer home or a home that has recently been remodeled, you may have a tankless system supplying hot water to your home.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters.
