<p>Removal - Most plumbers will charge between $250 and $500 to take the old water heater out and take it away for proper disposal. That's where an annual tank flush can come in handy, as it can remove these harmful sediments and ensure that your hot water tank is working at maximum efficiency. Kids won't be attracted to the inviting spigot, since the unit looks more like a computer than a hot water processor. The issue here is that you have used a lot of energy to heat the entire tank's capacity yet you do not use all of it. This equates to wasted resources and it is certainly reflected on your energy bill.</p>
