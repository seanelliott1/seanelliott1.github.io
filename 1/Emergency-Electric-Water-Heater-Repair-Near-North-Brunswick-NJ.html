<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>

<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>A recirculating pump will push the cold water in your pipes back to the water heater, saving water and making sure you have hot water as soon as you turn on the tap. These heaters are versatile enough to be used for a variety of purposes including bathrooms and hot tubs, for appliances like dishwashers and washing machines, and as a booster for solar water heaters. If your current system is outdated, there will be other costs such as replacing the ductwork or plumbing.</p>

<p>Turn off the water and gas or electric before you begin, and take particular care to vent gas models properly. Use 2 T joints to divide the hot and cold water inlets, so as to fit the water heater onto one side and the shower, sink, bath or washbasin on the other side. With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>

There is a real possibility that your home's existing gas line, gas meter, and piping are not appropriately sized to handle the high demand for gas that a tankless water heater would require.</p>
<p>Essential, the pressure relief valve protects the water heater against possible overpressure. Because of the way that tankless water heaters heat water, you can often end up with a slug of cold water when hot water is turned on, off, then on again.
