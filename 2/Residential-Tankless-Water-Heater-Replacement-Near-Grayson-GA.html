VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it.

<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there.

Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>These heaters are useful in residences as well as commercial establishments, and can be used in single and multiple unit set ups. A good quality water heater not only reduces the repair and maintenance charges but also acts as an energy saver. Gravity fed water heaters meet the water flow rate requirements and do not require a water efficient shower head or flow restrictor to be installed. It is important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into a dangerous time bomb.</p>
