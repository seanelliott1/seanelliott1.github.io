<h2>Water Heater Services Louisville Tennessee</h2>
<p>Your next door neighbor was up all night dealing with a busted water heater and you just spent the last half hour listening to him complain. Solar water heaters use a storage tank that stores water heated by the sun. Haven Heating and Air Conditioning is your local tankless water heater repair specialist, get in touch with us today. It's these two things: Flow Rate and Gallons Per Minute that determine what size heater you need and whether it should be gas or electric. There are several factors that can affect your water heater. Whether it's installation of a brand new tank or tankless, repair of an existing tank or preventative and regular maintenance to ensure that your tank is operating at its maximum potential, the experts at AirPlus Heating & Cooling can handle it. We are able to quickly and efficiently install a new unit in your home, should it be beyond repair.</p>
<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
