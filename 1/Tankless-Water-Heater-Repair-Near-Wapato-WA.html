<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>We've been working in and around the Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo area for over 20 years, and in that time have refined our services to become the best.

<p>Plumbers can contact the plumbers' water heater information line on 1300 883 019 (Monday to Friday, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm) for assistance. Water flow automatically ignites the water heater's burner, and your water is heated as it follows a serpentine path through the heating element.
