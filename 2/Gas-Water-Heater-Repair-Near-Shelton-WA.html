The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>
