<h2>Water Heater Services Gettysburg Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank.

<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
