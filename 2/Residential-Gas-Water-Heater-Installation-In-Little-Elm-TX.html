Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required. In many cases, cooler weather may result in the heater having to work harder to maintain the same temperature that it did in the warmer months.</p>

<p>Because water heaters are so important to your home's comfort, making sure your system performs at peak levels with as much efficiency as possible is of utmost importance. On top of that, electrical tankless water heaters cost less than most tankless gas units. So if your property does not already have a gas connection, the cost of making this connection will negate any cost savings of a tankless system. For this reason, installation costs will vary based on a home's floor plan and how far the piping needs to be directed through the house.</p>
<p>An electric tankless unit will cost about $500 to $700 , roughly the same as a traditional tank model, while the cost of a gas tankless heater runs about $1,000 to $1,200.
