<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>If the tank is cold or very hot, it may be difficult to get the expected changes when dialing in different temperatures on the thermostat. Next, the water heater must be connected to a fuel source. Before removing your old water heater, we'll assess your property's specific needs and recommend the most cost-effective option.
