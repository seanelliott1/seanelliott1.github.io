He will also show you the easy way to carry a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone. Tankless water heaters can be installed on walls, in garages, or outdoors using an anti-freeze kit. Also, as I mentioned earlier, tank-style heaters break down over time due to hard water causing the inner lining of the tank to rust and corrode.</p>
<p>Water consumption (amount of hot water to be used) is another important factor in determining which heating system to purchase. Denver water is quite cold, which creates condensation on the walls of hot water storage tanks. Electric water heaters use, you guessed it- electricity, to heat the water.

Then, look at every joint on the heater to make sure there is no leakages. However, the process is very easy with a tankless gas water heater. Whether you use a traditional or a tankless water heater, you need to keep an eye out for mineral buildup inside your water heater.</p>

To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
