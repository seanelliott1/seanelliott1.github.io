<p>For a standard 40 gallon water heater you now only have about 34 gallons. The short delay between when the water starts to flow and when the heater kicks on causes a short burst of cold water before turning hot. Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>That's because homes here are usually equipped for a standard, storage tank water heater. You are not afraid of running out of hot water again since they instantly heat water instead of warming a large bath tub or pool perhaps. One solution to the long wait is to install a small tank water heater after the tankless water heater to act as a tempering tank, but once you do that, it's no longer a truly tankless system.</p>

Storage tank is better than instant heater in terms of water pressure.</p>
<p>If you can't confidently say you know how to install a water heater you really need to use caution. As opposed to waiting for a storage tank to fill with enough hot water for use, tankless water heaters provide a constant supply of it. If you're looking for an energy-efficient option to supply your home with hot water, tankless water heaters are worth serious consideration. However, tankless water heaters are becoming standard in new developments, so if you live in a newer home or a home that has recently been remodeled, you may have a tankless system supplying hot water to your home.</p>

So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>

Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
