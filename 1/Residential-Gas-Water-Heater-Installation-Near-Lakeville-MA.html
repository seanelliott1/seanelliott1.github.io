<h2>Water Heater Services Lakeville Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>The climate can also affect how much the homeowner can save by opting for a tankless water heater. When it comes to your water heater, Radiant plumbers are equipped to perform maintenance, repairs, replacements, and also hot water heater installations. Tankless Water Heaters are much different from the traditional water heaters we have today. For example, electrical units don't need ventilation, so there's no need to install a ventilation line alongside a water line like you would with a gas unit.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>

Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>

<p>You'll need to find out how to dispose of your old water heater and check out the local codes for disposal. In this example, the whole-home tankless gas water heater is roughly $1000 more than the high-efficiency gas storage water heater over a 15 year time period.
