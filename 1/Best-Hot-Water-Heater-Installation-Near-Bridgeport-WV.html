<h2>Water Heater Services Bridgeport West Virginia</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>High-Efficiency Products: We carry some of the most efficient products on the market, and our high-efficiency water heaters help save money on your utilities. With a storage water heater, you have to wait at least 10 minutes between each shower for the hot water supply to replenish. There are fewer moving parts in a space heating water heater and this means easy maintenance and fewer services. When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area. In addition to high upfront costs, smaller tankless units don't always deliver enough hot water to appliances and showers simultaneously. Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>

Time-Saving: Also, as the water is heater right away, there is no wait for the tank to heat up once someone has taken a shower. However, a tankless model might not be the most suitable option for you if you have a large home or use a significant amount of water daily.</p>
<p>A 50 gallon hot water tank will typically only be able to provide about 35 gallons of hot water before it runs out. If you move your gas water heater system installation to a different hot water system installation location, the gas hot water heater installation cost could be between $1000 and $2500. A tankless water heater can provide you with all of the hot water your family needs on demand, and there's no fear that you'll run out at the worst possible moment.</p>

The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot. Most property owners don't think about replacing water heaters until it's a need. For example, many homes, regardless of the type of fuel source used to heat hot water tanks now require a 4” exhaust pipe.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Bridgeport West Virginia 26330</h3>
<p>A backup heating element is in the tank, so you'll have plenty of hot water, no matter what the weather. Tankless water heaters can also be used as a booster for dishwashers, washing machines, and as a backup for solar or wood-fired domestic systems. However, once they run out of water, users must wait for a new tank to reheat. If you're worried about installation costs, then you might want to consider electric tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>Space: These units have a much smalller footprint because they don't have a huge tank attached. You can reclaim the space that was previously taken by a large hot water heater tank. Just note the date, brand, model, whether it's electric or gas, and the size of the tank. It can also differ based on where you live, but Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning will give you information on the best options for the North America area and your distinct needs.</p>
<p>Be careful to ensure that your water heater is convenient and safe in case of future servicing. Remember, with tankless, there is no preheated reservoir of water. Once you close the hot water tap, the unit senses that the flow of water has stopped and shuts off the heating element. Get up to 36 months to pay for your new water heater, subject to credit approval. Condensing water heaters have a tank like a conventional storage tank water heater, but they capture hot exhaust gases that would normally be expelled from a home out the flue.</p>
<p>All these are the drawbacks for the traditional water heater tanks. Tankless gas water heaters eliminate storage losses and work more efficiently than tankless electric water heaters.
