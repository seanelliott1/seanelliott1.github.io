<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>

<p>Water heaters are dangerous and can cause a variety of hazardous conditions both for the person attempting to tinker with the heater and for the residents of the entire household.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Westport Connecticut 06880</h3>
<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts. You can expect to pay much less for your hot water when you use a tankless system. This is due to the fact that hot water tanks store water that can experience what is called "standby" losses, when heat evaporates through the flue or sides of the tank. As your water heater is used day in and day out, expect to have to perform some amount of repair.</p>
<p>Tankless water heating systems effectively cancels out the standby heat losses made by storage type heaters. However, in that 30 plus year span, it has been determined that tankless water heaters can be expected to last for 20 years or more with minimal care and maintenance being required.

Not only do we offer water heater repair for your home or business, but we also install water heaters, as well.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
