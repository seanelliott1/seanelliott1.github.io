However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>
<p>Strategically planning the location of your tankless water heater maximizes its flow and water temperatures. When you turn on the faucet, warm water is pumped from the top of the tank to where you need it and cold water is pumped into the bottom of the tank to be heated until its ready for use. Even though tankless water heaters can deliver an unlimited amount of hot water, there's a limit to how much water can be delivered at once.</p>

<p>It is so quick to heat and be replaced that you never seem to run out of hot water. Tank water heaters are a standard type of water heater. The tankless water heating system seems to be the best option as it significantly saves time and energy. Like our other services, your new water heater will be covered by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. This heat from the pilot flame causes a tiny electrical signal to be sent to the control valve, telling the control valve that there is a flame present so it's OK to let the gas through to the main burner when the thermostat calls for heat.</p>

The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. If you notice physical damage to your water heater, call us for hot water tank repair right away. Many people wonder when to replace a water heater and when to repair it. The answer is when it has started leaking.</p>

We suggest reading up on our Advantage Program to potentially avoid problems with your water heater. Keep in mind, however, that as a trusted water heater contractor, our most important goal when working on your project is to do it correctly, instead of quickly.</p>
<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
