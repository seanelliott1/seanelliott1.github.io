<h2>Water Heater Services Whitehall Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>
<p>Gas tankless water heaters have a longer life expectancy than traditional tank water heaters. At Green Hills Plumbing we offer quality tankless water heater installation and service. Numerous people don't consider purchasing a new hot water heater until their old ones break down, yet the newer models could end up saving the home owner money in terms of energy expenditures so purchasing one now might save money for the household.</p>
<p>Many people think that electric hot water heaters are very expensive, and there are commercials seen often that indicate that gas water heaters are a better choice because they cost less and they keep working when the power goes out. A broken unit can quickly leave you without any hot water, which is why it's good to know what warning signs to look for to get timely repair services. These replacement models have been designed to save on running costs by having no fixed pilot.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Whitehall</h3>
<p>Also consider the hot water heater installation cost or water heater replacement cost. Additionally, if you have a gas system, you will need to modify the gas lines feeding the heater and this can be very costly. All this makes choosing a gas or electric tankless hot water heater a local matter. A tank-less water heater has lower operating costs, uses less space and can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30%.</p>

Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>

A malfunctioning water heater is inconvenient and potentially expensive if you need to replace the unit.

No matter what issue you start to encounter with your tankless water heater, you must have licensed professionals handle any fixes.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, need to heat water as it passes through.

A lot of that is contextual, and could depend on usage, maintenance, and, yes, a bit of luck. This is when flushing the tank is necessary for a quick water heater repair. New installs require retrofit - Replacing your traditional water heater with a tankless hot water heater can be complicated and involve increased installation costs.</p>
<p>Your water heater's heating elements and thermostat can also wear out, leaving you with a fluctuating temperature or no hot water at all. Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility. Wait a little while, then check the water temperature at a faucet.</p>
