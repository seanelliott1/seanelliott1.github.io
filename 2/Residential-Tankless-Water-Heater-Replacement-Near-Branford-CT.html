<h2>Water Heater Services Branford Connecticut</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>High-Efficiency Products: We carry some of the most efficient products on the market, and our high-efficiency water heaters help save money on your utilities. With a storage water heater, you have to wait at least 10 minutes between each shower for the hot water supply to replenish. There are fewer moving parts in a space heating water heater and this means easy maintenance and fewer services. When the heater needs to serve several fixtures, you still need to select a location that reduces the total length of hot water piping.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Repair Branford</h3>
<p>Even with federal and local rebates, what you'll spend to buy and install a solar system can mean waiting 10 to 30 years to recover your investment costs, although solar panels and equipment are becoming less costly all the time. The liquid used in this system, often a form of antifreeze will be cycled through solar panels and then down to the hot water tank. Brass vs. plastic drain valves: These are situated near the base of the water heater for a garden hose that drains the heater.</p>
<p>Then, be aware that when full, a 200L water heater like this one will weigh 260 kg. Therefore, you will need to ensure it is very securely attached. Clogged drain repair might seem like something you can do yourself, but there are advantages to calling a professional drain cleaning company to help maintain your pipes. Water is typically heated to 120 degrees F, so if you are heating, for example, 55° F cold water to 120° F, you have a 65° F temperature rise.</p>

<h3>Necessary Services That A Good Plumbing Service Can Provide Branford CT</h3>
<p>Like all other plumbing systems in your home, regular maintenance can ensure your home's hot water heater continues to perform at its very best. Whenever removing electric elements on an electric water heater, be sure that the electricity is turned off. Tankless units last about 5-10 years longer than conventional units. Even if you are replacing your water heater with a conventional one, the installation process is not as simple as it might seem.</p>
<p>Look at the panel on the side of your water heater. See Heat Pump Water Heaters for more information. When a hot water tap is turned on, cold water travels through a pipe into the unit.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Branford Connecticut 06405</h3>
<p>Water heaters can only be installed by an appropriately licensed plumbing contractor or registered plumbing worker and they must provide the household and the Office of the Technical Regulator with a certificate of compliance for the installation within seven days of completing the work. When you turn on a hot water valve or an appliance that draws hot water such as a washing machine or dishwasher, the gas-fired tankless water heater will draw cold water in through the cold-water inlet pipe on one side.</p>
<p>That means performing the manufacturer's recommended preventive water heater maintenance , periodically draining the tank (or lines) to remove damaging sediment and scale. Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines. Your circuit breaker might also have to be reviewed; the Electric Tankless Water Heater might also have to be installed on its own circuits.</p>
<p>They are smaller than conventional storage heaters, are wall mounted and do not take up floor space. Common problems you can expect to experience include low gas pressure, a low heating capacity, or rusty-looking water. Make sure when you call a plumber you call a licensed plumber that is experienced in repairing tankless water heaters. Also, contact your city or town for information about obtaining a permit, if necessary, and about local water heater installation codes.</p>
<p>Tightening the heating element mounting bolt - Make sure not to overtighten this, though. Installing a whole-house water softener can mitigate calcium buildup, lengthening the life of your water heater. We offer both conventional and tankless water heater options, rebates and eco-friendly discounts. But, as the concept of heating water on demand become more popular, and because tankless water heaters are more energy efficient, homebuilders began installing them.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
