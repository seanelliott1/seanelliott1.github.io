This means that you might need a larger unit or multiple units if you have a simultaneous demand from multiple showers, faucets, or other hot water consumers like a washing machine.

<h3>Water Tank Repair Smyrna Tennessee 37167</h3>
<p>Whether you need emergency repairs to your existing system, or are considering upgrading your hot water heater, we can help you understand the cost and energy saving benefits of the options available. Some models, known as single point units, install close to the water source and are fairly inexpensive to purchase and install. That varies with the location and design of the unit, quality of installation, maintenance schedule and water quality.</p>
<p>Place the water heater in a drip pan made for this purpose if the equipment is located inside the home, and especially if it is in the attic. Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>

Rheem Tankless  Water Heaters offer the savings, comfort and protection  you need. Most tankless water heaters can supply sufficient warm water to your entire household, but if your family uses a considerable volume on a daily basis, you'll want to make sure the unit you select is sized to meet your needs.</p>
<p>That's where tankless, often called on-demand,” water heaters come in. You can get a low-end 50-gallon tank water heater for around $500 but a top-of-the-line Rinnai or Navien may cost around $1,500. Your water heater does not supply hot water constantly. With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust.
