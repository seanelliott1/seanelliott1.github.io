<h2>Water Heater Services Lebanon Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>As with many household devices, water heaters become more expensive to maintain as they get older. For this reason, you need a repair expert who is experienced in handling tankless style heaters, and that's exactly what HomeWorks water heater repair technicians can offer you. Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>
