Because methods for repairing the problem may depend on whether your water heater is gas or electric, these are discussed separately below. Electric Water Heater: For homes that are powered mainly by electricity, an electric water heater is likely the best option.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters usually need more gas than even the biggest home furnaces. We have been specializing in San Jose water heaters including installation, replacement & repair since 1968. Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>

Our hot water installation services are second to none because we only employ technicians who have been certified to handle the job.</p>

<p>I am sure that at least 50 percent of homes in the U.S. will at some time have to use their homeowners insurance to cover the costs of damages caused by busted water heaters. If this is the case then try to find the place which your pipe or tankless heater is frozen and thaw as soon as possible to prevent the pipe from bursting.

<p>If you do opt for a whole house tankless heater then get yourself a hot water demand system. If your water heater has an EF of at least 0.82, you can qualify for federal tax credit.
