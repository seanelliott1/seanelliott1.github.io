<h2>Water Heater Services Marlborough Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>If there weren't a dip tube the incoming cold water would constantly be cooling down the heated water and you would think that something is wrong with the heater because you are quickly running out of hot water. Each hot water heater comes with a digital control pad that allows you to control the water temperature for various water outlets in your home or business. There are many different types of water heaters on the market.</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>

When you're dealing with a broken water heater, AC unit, or some other indoor comfort issue, you want to make sure the company you call will work with you to fix it, and not just provide a service to mask the real problem.
