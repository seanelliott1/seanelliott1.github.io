Set up your tankless water heater installation in the Pittsburg and Antioch, CA area today. A whole house unit would be installed in a central location and completely replaces a standard tank water heater. Ideally, a full flush will be performed, but in which case the heater has to be turned off beforehand and the tank has to be full.</p>
<p>Energy efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water. Efficiency: Tankless units are also more efficient since they are not running all the time. Prior to replacing your tank hot water heater, make sure that you contact your local municipality for information about obtaining building and plumbing permits. You may have to have a new electric circuit breaker installed by a professional electrician.</p>
