<p>To avoid flooding from tank failure, Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating offers alarm and cold water shut-off valve options. Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>Tankless water heating systems effectively cancels out the standby heat losses made by storage type heaters. However, in that 30 plus year span, it has been determined that tankless water heaters can be expected to last for 20 years or more with minimal care and maintenance being required. While these units will similarly fuel your system, the main differences occur in operating cost. Plumbers are pros at fitting pipes and stopping leaks, but that doesn't mean they can troubleshoot electrical problems, adjust gas pressures, or monitor combustion safety.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>You will also need to include the costs of parts and materials necessary for installation. At PV, we repair all makes and models of tankless water heaters. Everyday tank water heaters retain large capacities of water, commonly around 50 gallons at once. Also, any repair work needed for gas heaters is best left to an experienced technician to avoid the risk of gas leaks, fire or personal injury. The team at Valdel Plumbing is here to provide excellence in water heater repair or installation.</p>
<p>While you'll usually pay a bit more for longer-warranty models, we've found that they tend to have larger elements or burners that can speed up water heating and have thicker insulation for less heat loss. To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient. Don't go without hot water, call Miracle Plumbing Inc.</p>
