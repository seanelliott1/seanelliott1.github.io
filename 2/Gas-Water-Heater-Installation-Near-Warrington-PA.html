<p>When you need to repair your water heater and you have forgotten where you put your warranty or manual, it helps to have some tips to guide you along the way. You don't want to have to deal with issues with your water heater installation such as having to re-install it, leaks, or having to spend money to replace it.

Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
