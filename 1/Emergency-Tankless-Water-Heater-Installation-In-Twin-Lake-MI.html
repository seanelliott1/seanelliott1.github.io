Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>
<p>Gas-fired tank-type water heaters use a burner centered underneath the tank to heat the hot water storage tank, which in turn heats the water within the tank. You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy. Another reason for sticking with the more popular tankless water heater manufacturers is for the reasons of maintenance.</p>

<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
