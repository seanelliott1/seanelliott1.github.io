The certified, experienced plumbing professionals at Putman & Son's Plumbing will do the job right the first time around, ensuring that you don't have to deal with costly repairs or mistakes that will end up being a major inconvenience in the future if they lead to water heater issues or leaks.</p>

When you turn on the first shower, that cold water moves to the water heater. Traditional - A traditional water heater comes with a sizable tank, where hot water is stored until it is needed.
