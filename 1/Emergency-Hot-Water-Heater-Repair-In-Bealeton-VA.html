<h2>Water Heater Services Bealeton Virginia</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Water heater failure can happen anytime and may lead to your tank fully discharging, potential damage and temporary loss of service. Specialists from Downey Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning will help you reach your goals when it comes to water heating systems. The tankless water heaters also cause an increase in water wastage since you have to let the water run longer to get your hot water. Before finalizing everything, make sure that you do enough comparison with the existing heaters that are out in the market.</p>
<p>It might seem like it would be easy to install a water heater, but it is actually a lot more complex than it looks. According to , For homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily, demand (or tankless) water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters.” Tankless water heaters (if gas-fired) will save homeowners over $100 annually the longer they remain in service.</p>

<p>Because these systems provide hot water on demand, they don't require a storage tank to store hot water. Replacing your old water heater with a newer and more energy efficient unit can benefit your home and save you money on your utility costs. A well-maintained water heater can last a long time, but eventually it's going to be time to replace it. Nowadays, the homeowner has a range of water heater types to choose from.</p>
<p>If you live in a multi-person household, compare tankless models, paying particular attention to the gallons per minute (GPM) flow of each model. Even when there is no demand, the water must be reheated every time the temperature falls below the thermostat threshold. When the stored water cools due to standby heat loss, a thermostat in the tank triggers the reheating process. And because the heat pump is on top, a hybrid water heater needs as much as 7 feet of clearance from floor to ceiling.</p>

If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas coming from its location, you have a potentially dangerous situation on your hands. In electric water heaters, if hot water comes out for a very short span of time, the first thing to check is the thermostat setting. No storage or holding tank means that tankless water heaters have a life span twice as long as traditional systems because the risk of rust and corrosion is significantly lower.</p>
<p>Most tankless water heaters can be repaired and have parts exchanged as well, so replacing the entire water heater every 6-8 years is a thing of the past. In the case of the gas tankless water heater installation you are required to have a PVC vent installed that penetrates the roof of your home or that you mount it on the outside of the home and purchase a special outdoor tankless water heater which may also require an enclosure and re-working your water supply lines.</p>
