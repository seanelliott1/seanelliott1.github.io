Because the tankless water heater is going to only give the hot water as it is needed instead of having it sit in the tank all the time waiting for you to use it. Then you will not need to worry about having any one getting burnt because they were messing around the hot water tank when they should have not been.</p>
<p>Outside of the GPM produced by most tankless heaters, there are a few heaters that go beyond the average, heating 7.5-11 GPM. Tankless water heaters feature an adjustable thermostat control. Don't pay to heat a tank full of water while away or worry about a tank water heater springing a leak.
