<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement.

While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
