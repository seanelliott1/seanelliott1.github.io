A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room.

<p>The worst traditional electric heaters are 93 percent efficient. Maybe your hot water heater has sprung a leak or it's just stopped working.

A broken or deteriorated dip tube can cause the cold water to stay near the top, making your water heater unable to heat the water properly. There are a lot of reasons why a homeowner or business owner might choose to upgrade to a new water heater, with some of them ranging from the size to the water heater's ability to heat up water.</p>
