A tankless water heater typically relies on an in-line filter to prevent sediment and other solids from entering and clogging the heat exchanger. Price with installation: Varies dramatically depending on the type, brand, your home, and whether you are installing a new heater or replacing an old one.</p>

<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
