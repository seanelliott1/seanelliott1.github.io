<h2>Water Heater Services South San Francisco California</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>In third place is the gas-powered tankless water heater. Water, not warming enough is one of the most straightforward sign you will receive from your instant water heater if something is wrong. And electric tankless models draw so much power—120 to 160 amps—that you may have to upgrade the electrical service to your house to 200 amps or more. In most cases, a person is going to notice that there are small signs that the water heater is getting ready to fail before it completely quits.</p>

If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
