<h2>Water Heater Services Houma Louisiana</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>

<p>Also consider the hot water heater installation cost or water heater replacement cost. Additionally, if you have a gas system, you will need to modify the gas lines feeding the heater and this can be very costly. All this makes choosing a gas or electric tankless hot water heater a local matter. A tank-less water heater has lower operating costs, uses less space and can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30%.</p>

With a gas heater turn the thermostat knob to the pilot setting. Tankless heaters provide continuous hot water, so gone are the days of the hot water running out mid-shower. Inadequate Water Flow: Another thing to be aware of is that if minerals build up in the tankless water heater, they can cause slow water flow from faucets and taps.</p>
<p>Removal of current system: another issue to consider is that the removal and disposal costs of your current water heater, which can be upwards of $500 dollars, based on your area. Gas water heaters use a gas powered pilot light to heat the water that you enjoy in your home. Having a new hot water tank installed in King or Pierce County takes a matter of hours, but will ensure that you have full access to hot water for years to come.</p>
