Well, they're specifically trained in all aspects of a water heater (including electrical wiring, piping, heating elements, anode rods, gas lines, etc.).</p>

However, if you're looking to make your home more energy efficient, our technicians may recommend replacing a less-efficient unit with one that heats better and uses less energy.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
<p>On more recent water heaters, the combustion chamber may be sealed. This matters since it would require more power to heat colder water. There can be huge variances in what different gas fitters charge for hot water system installation cost. If this happens, you should reduce the demand for hot water by limiting simultaneous applications, and you may want to consider resetting your unit. Traditional tank water heaters take up valuable space in a basement, attic or closet—space you could use.</p>
