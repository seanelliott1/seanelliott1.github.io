<p>We are trained and equipped to repair and maintain all makes and models of water heaters. However, if you prefer to install your new water heater DIY-style, be prepared to spend a couple of hours in order to finish the whole setup.

<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>The rate of hot water produced by a tankless water heater is two to five gallons per minute, depending on the heating style used. The very same holds true for refurbished tankless water heaters.
