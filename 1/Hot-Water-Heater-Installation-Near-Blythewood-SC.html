From small accounting offices to corner stores, from large malls to huge factories, Parkway Mechanical supplies tankless water heating solutions for local businesses in the Northwest Indiana & Illinois areas.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough.

<h3>Hot Water Heater Replacement Blythewood</h3>
<p>Tankless: Tankless water heaters tend to cost more up front than storage tank models. Hot water heaters come in all shapes and sizes, some fueled by natural gas or oil, some by electricity or propane. If these tanks are replaced with tankless hot water heaters, newfound space can be converted into another resident amenity, such as on-site storage or laundry, both of which can bring in extra revenue. Most heaters are not sold with these jackets in place so a lot of heat can be lost through the tanks body.</p>

The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>

The key feature is that the heater does not turn on until it senses that a hot water tap is being opened. They only heat the water as it's needed, unlike storage tank water heaters that require continuous maintenance of the temperature of the water in the tank.</p>
<p>In the one tank system, the solar storage and the backup heater are all part of the same unit, and in the two-tank system, the solar component in the system heats the water before it is fed through to the water heater. That's right, some people actually see their gas bills go up because more hot water is being used since there's more available now.
