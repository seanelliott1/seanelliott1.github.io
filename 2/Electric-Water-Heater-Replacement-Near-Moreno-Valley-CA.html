<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results. Failure to do so can result in poor water heater performance, complete water heater failure, and even health issues. With a Rinnai® tankless water heater you'll enjoy the total confidence that comes with more than 30 years of innovation, support and integrity. A tankless water heater not only offer on-demand hot water, but this type of water heater comes in both electric and gas options.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Moreno Valley</h3>
<p>Also consider the hot water heater installation cost or water heater replacement cost. Additionally, if you have a gas system, you will need to modify the gas lines feeding the heater and this can be very costly. All this makes choosing a gas or electric tankless hot water heater a local matter. A tank-less water heater has lower operating costs, uses less space and can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30%.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
<p>July 1, 2007 - WH conversion to FVIR design has been extended to all residential water heaters with inputs of 75 000 BTU's or less including Power Direct-Vent, Direct-Vent, Manufactured Housing and larger gallon capacity models not covered in the first two phases. Improper installation of a water heater could cause catastrophic damage or injury if the unit is not installed properly.

Instead, heating elements are used that heat the water as it is needed. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models).
