Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates. And keep in mind that because of recent federal energy regulations, a replacement storage tank may take up more space than your old one, even if it's the same capacity, because newer ones are required to have more insulation.</p>

<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create.

<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit.

<p>Tankless Water Heater Installations also typically require a flush kit to be installed for maintenance purposes. Replacing the anode rod regularly will significantly increase the life span of the water heater. Popular water heater brands are popular because of their reputation, and brands vary in price. Consequently, a tankless water heater is able to deliver as much instant hot water as you need and not a drop more.</p>
