<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>

He will also show you the easy way to carry a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone. Tankless water heaters can be installed on walls, in garages, or outdoors using an anti-freeze kit.

If using a single point unit, you want the unit fairly close to where the hot water will be used in order to deliver the water in a timely way.

To prevent this pressure from building up, every water heater uses a relief valve in its construction. Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient.
