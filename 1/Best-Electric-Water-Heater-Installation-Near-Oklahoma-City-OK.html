Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required. In many cases, cooler weather may result in the heater having to work harder to maintain the same temperature that it did in the warmer months.</p>

<p>Storage water heaters lose heat and can cost a lot of money in maintenance over time. The main advantage of tankless water heaters is that they are energy efficient and save you money over the long term. A main unit could be repositioned to shorten the run to some of the most used outlets while a smaller electric on-demand heater could be use to supplement in a bedroom or utility room. Plus, many tankless units, even those that run on gas, require an electrical connection to operate, which may require an additional supply line to be installed.</p>

As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>
<p>Incorrect Size: When you first bought your water heater, it could've been the perfect size for your needs-things change as well as water needs, so you may want a new water heater to meet those specific needs. Once it has been determined that a tankless heater will benefit you, our professionally trained technicians will assess your ground water temperature and determine the flow of water through your home or business to help determine which model will be the best fit for your needs.</p>
