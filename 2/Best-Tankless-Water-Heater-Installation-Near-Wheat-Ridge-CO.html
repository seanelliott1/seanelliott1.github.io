<p>Gas water heaters will have a higher FHR compared to an electric heater with the same sized tank. It's estimated that gas water heaters last for up to 10 years and electric ones up to 15 ‚ but don't think you don't have to maintain and troubleshoot certain things about your hot water heater to meet, or even exceed, these projected lifetimes. The installation process is more time-consuming, and fewer plumbers know how to install them correctly.</p>
<p>A gas water heater can be used even during power outages, and are usually more ideal for a large family, as they have a fast recovery time. While these are cost-efficient at first buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable way for you to receive hot water, especially if your unit is outdated. One of the most important ways to maintain the functionality of a tank-type water heater is to flush the tank.
