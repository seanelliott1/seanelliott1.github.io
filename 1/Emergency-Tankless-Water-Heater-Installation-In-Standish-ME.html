<h2>Water Heater Services Standish Maine</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>

Black Pipe Fittings - You may need a few ½ black pipe couplings and elbows to extend or shorten the gas line connecting to the heater. Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular due to the energy savings and consistent flow of hot water. Tankless models cost up to three times as much as a tank water heater, but they more than compensate for it with their unique benefits.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Standish</h3>
<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently. Following a "heavy use" industry standard test, we compared the performance of gas and electric tankless water heaters with the performance of their conventional tank counterparts.</p>
<p>Combining the higher hot water output of a tank heater with the limitless heating capacity of tankless, ENERGY STAR-certified hybrid or heat pump water heaters often pay for themselves in under two years. For many water heater repairs, it makes a difference whether the water heater is gas or electric. Electric models do not produce greenhouse gases. The experts at RupCoe Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning offer tankless water heater repair and tankless water heater installation services to homes in the South Plainfield, NJ area.</p>

Water travels in pipes through solar collectors (typically installed on your roof), where it is heated by the sun. Turn on the cold water supply valve to the water heater and turn on the water supply valve (or the house water supply, as applicable). Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers" are the most common water heaters installed for the last 120 years or so and are used for central heating and can also heat the water for your home using steam.</p>

<p>The most obvious drawback to a tankless water heater is the higher cost for both the unit and the installation. When sediment has built up inside your tank or the heating element stops working, we might be able to repair it. Elements can corrode due to a higher mineral content in the water such as you typically find with well water. Tankless water heating technology checks all the boxes to a more comfortable home.</p>
<p>In addition to providing expert tankless water heater repairs, we also specialize in installations and replacements. Other materials, including heat pumps and pipes, are not included in standard installation costs. In locations where water has a high mineral content, otherwise known as hard water, add a water softener to reduce the unwanted effects that those mineral deposits can have on the water heater tank.</p>

We are Calgary-based, but offer water heater repair service in the surrounding communities. Such advice has saved many of them the cost of repairs, common accidents, loss of business revenue and energy consumption.
