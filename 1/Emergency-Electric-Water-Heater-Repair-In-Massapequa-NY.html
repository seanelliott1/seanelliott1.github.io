<p>If you currently have a gas system then purchase a tankless water heater system that also operates on gas. Plumbing-supply stores, big-box stores, and online retailers all carry these heaters. By periodically draining the water heater tank and having a thorough rinse performed by our professionals, you'll be able to keep mineral buildup to a minimum. Consequently, the lack of maintenance plays a big role in repair costs and necessity.</p>
<p>Just as soon as the overall temperature drops, the thermostat signals the heating element to work. Replacing your water heater can ultimately lead to saving you time, money and stress down the road. If you feel the price of keeping your old unit may be getting out of hand, it's probably time to think about tankless water heater replacement. There are a variety of methods for heating water, so you need an expert to recommend the ideal solution for your home or commercial building.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Massapequa</h3>
<p>Energy Savings: Because these units only heat water when it's needed, you can save big on energy costs. Water heaters are essentially steel tanks with vitreous glass bonded to the inside to protect the steel from rust. Retrofitting a home with a tankless unit can be a complicated process as compared to traditional storage tank and may cost as high as $3,000. Gas water heater: Turn off the gas supply at the shutoff valve on the gas pipe nearest the water heater.</p>
<p>It should be able to provide enough hot water during the busiest time of usage. And a popular fuel choice for this type of water heater is natural gas. By combining a tankless heater and a hot water demand system you get the best of both green worlds, reduced energy consumption and heavy duty water savings. We are happy to replace your troubled water heater with a new unit that is fully warranted and serviced by Mike Diamond Services.</p>

Check your work by first filling the tank with water and making sure that there are no leaks in your plumbing job.</p>
<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Massapequa NY</h3>
<p>Water heaters are heavy - use a helper, appliance dolly or hand truck when moving the appliance. Next, touch the water heater's temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve and the hot water outlet pipe above the water heater (see water heater diagrams above ). Some electric water heater problems may be more serious, however. If only the hot water is discolored or smelly, it's because there's a high concentration of sulfates or other minerals in your tank.</p>
<p>Thanks to the low emission of potentially health-threatening elements tankless water heaters are environment-friendly. If your current hot water heater cannot meet your needs, new water heater installation is likely the best choice. Higher installation cost - You might run into a higher installation cost because of venting requirements, as well as the placement of additional tankless units around the home. If your existing hot water heater is good, just requiring maintenance, minor repairs, or new fittings, we can get you working again in no time.</p>
<p>The most efficient storage tank has an energy factor of about67, but according to Energy Star, some tankless units have energy factors as high as95. Whole-home water heating systems may cost a little more upfront than a tank-style heater, but over time these systems usually pay for themselves time and time again. We'll also test for rust and do everything we can to keep your water heater running well so you can always have the hot water you need.</p>

<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there.

Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>

According to CostHelper , the installation cost of a storage water heater may be as low as $200 and the installation cost for a tankless water heater may be as low as $1000.
