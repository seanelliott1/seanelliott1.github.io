Added Property Value: Whether you're planning on selling, or looking for high-end renters for your property, a tankless water heater is a great selling point for your property.

They are also insulated to keep the water hot between heating cycles. It's time to replace your unit.</p>
<p>This problem is only compounded as sediment build up in the tank over time and reduces the amount of hot water the tank can store.

<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>The tankless heating system works better for our environment and users get to save more. Switch off the electric supply to the heater at the circuit breaker.

In California, most homeowners spend around $1,000 to hire a plumber for a basic tankless or demand-type water heater installation.</p>
<p>Also, if you live in an area where most of the homes are upgrading to tankless units, it may be a good idea to do the same so your property remains in competitive with the rest of the area homes (from a real estate standpoint). The gas tankless water heater installation cost would also be in the $250 and $700 range to replace an old tankless system with the same type in the same spot. This type of heater depends on the application and the availability of the other types.</p>
