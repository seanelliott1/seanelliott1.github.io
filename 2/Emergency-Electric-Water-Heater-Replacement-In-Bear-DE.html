<h2>Water Heater Services Bear Delaware</h2>
<p>Many consumers are choosing to upgrade their current tank water heater to the new and improved tankless water heater systems that are available. We provide everything from hot water tank replacement to water heater maintenance. I called and the very next day they came out and repaired my heating service and did an excellent job. As mentioned, installing a new water heater of any type requires expertise in electrical, gas, and plumbing. Colder incoming groundwater temperature will limit the product options to the higher kW units, which require a larger electrical service and breaker size capacity.</p>
<p>If the water heater is located in an attic, water damage can result in every ceiling and floor beneath the water heater. Your water requirements will also have to be considered when choosing a tankless water heater. Our GoHot tankless heater is only the size of a briefcase. Since we are talking about electric tankless, the only thing I will say about gas models is that they almost always have better performance than electric models.</p>

Changing to a tankless system like the Tempra® eliminates these problems and results in typical savings of at least 15 - 20% on the hot water portion of your electric bill. Never attempt to do it without first reading all the instructions that can with your particular tankless water heater. While you can help prolong the life of your water heater with annual maintenance, chances are you'll need to have the pre-existing tank replaced with a new one if you occupy a given residence for more than eight years.</p>
<p>Further, a tankless gas water heater has a life span of 10 to 15 years. If your water heater is no longer producing hot water, or if the tank is leaking, you need to take care of it right away. If the tankless system costs $2,200 installed, and saves $116 a year, it would take about 19 years to break even on the investment. Point-of-use units are used to quickly supply hot water to a source not located near the home's central water heater.</p>
<p>It takes a good amount of time for the tank to fill back up, turn on the burner, and heat the water. In a gas based tankless system, the gas heater is responsible for heating the water. If you answered no” to one or more of these questions, especially, question #1, you should probably hold off and stick with a tank-style heater. We can relocate your water heater if needed. After you are sure that everything is connected back properly, open the valve to fill the tank up, while this is happening i would open up a few hot water faucets just to get some of the air out.</p>

However, if you prefer to install your new water heater DIY-style, be prepared to spend a couple of hours in order to finish the whole setup. The first step in installing a tankless system is ensuring all components of the system are correctly designed including properly sizing pumps, managing water pressures, determining correct numbers of circulating units, and providing for freeze protection.</p>
<p>2. Electrical tankless water heaters can require upgraded electrical service of much higher amperage than you currently have. When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>Scale can build up on the heating elements causing all sorts of noises to occur while heating. Our company provides prompt and efficient services with warranty for installation and repair. If possible, get a water heater with a separate anode rod, which will usually have a hex head on top where the anode screws into the tank. Most electric water heaters have two heating elements. Most water heaters, including tankless water heaters and natural gas tankless water heaters, have an expected service life of no more than 10 to 13 years, depending on system use, local water chemistry and maintenance provided.</p>
