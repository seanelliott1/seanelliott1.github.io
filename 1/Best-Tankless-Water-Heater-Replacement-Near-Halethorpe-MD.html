<h2>Water Heater Services Halethorpe Maryland</h2>
<p>Not many of us know a whole lot about water heaters or water heater repair. Electric heaters are often cheaper to purchase and the spare parts needed for repairs are usually easy to find and cheap to buy. Water heaters are one of the unsung heroes of the plumbing world. By no means does this list include everything that is and should be checked on a water heating system but, hopefully, it will help you to know more about your system than you knew before and protect you from harm. ENERGY STAR certified models are available for water heater tanks.</p>
<p>Your hot water heater controls the water temperature of your home or business. In a gas powered setup the components include an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, a gas control valve and a thermocouple. Luckily we at Lascko Services have the expertise needed to provide you with the very best water heater service around. A water heater replacement in most cases can be installed and working perfectly within a just a few hours as well, excluding unexpected complications.</p>
<p>Gas fittings and electrical connections age and wear out over time as well, all of which can lead to the decision to replace your current water heater. Water heaters that have not been properly installed and inspected can become a fire, explosion and health hazard for your building and occupants. Once we find the issue with your water heater we will be able to repair it then and there. This is because instead of wasting energy keep water warm in a tank, a tankless water heater only heats water as you use it.</p>

<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>But now you may be asking yourself, How does the water get hot?” That depends on whether you have a gas-fired tank-type water heater or an electrical tank-type water heater.
