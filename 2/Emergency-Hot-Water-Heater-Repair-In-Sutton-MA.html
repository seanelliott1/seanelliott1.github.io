<p>Make sure you have all the proper tools and materials you need to properly install a Hot Water Tank. We sell a complete line of gas and electric hot water heaters from top manufacturers like Rheem, Bradford White, Bosch, State, Reliance, Noritz and A. Smith. Be sure to let us know if you plan on installing a hot tub, spa, or jacuzzi in the future. A properly installed tankless heater can certainly save a large amount of energy over a traditional water heater. A cold shower is a sure sign that your Gwinn home needs water heater maintenance.</p>
<p>Age- Most water heaters last roughly 10 - 15 years. A plumbing inspector will come to your place and look at the installation to make sure that the work was done properly. Rust: Anytime there's rust on the outside of your tank, around fittings, or in the water itself, you're water heater may be on its last legs. Solar power water heater systems use the sun's energy to generate warm water for your home. The compact designs of this kind of heater leaves space for a water softener or additional storage such as "use it as you need it".</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>

Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, do not store water.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of time before your water heater will need to be replaced and it is always better to schedule it out than deal with an untimely breakdown. Replacing your hot water tank can be a costly venture. In comparison, the average life expectancy of an electric tank water heater is about 12 or 13 years.
