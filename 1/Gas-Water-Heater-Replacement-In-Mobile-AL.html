A water heater is not only useful for your bath but also for your laundry, dishwashing etc. Replacement of a traditional water tank is usually needed because of the build-up of scale and rust on the inside of the tank. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently ready. While traditional water heaters maintain a constant supply of hot water for your use, a tankless unit heats water quickly on demand.</p>
<p>We install tankless water heaters for commercial and residential customers in the South Bay & Los Angeles, including Torrance, Redondo Beach, Harbor City & surrounding areas.

<p>Buyers must also have realistic expectations regarding the performance of the tankless water heater they intend to buy. The tanklees electric water heater heats the water immediately when it is turned on. There is a heating element, or several heating elements, in the pipe and as the water flows over them, it gets heated up. These appliances are easy to install, provide great value, require less maintenance and offer every member of the family an unlimited supply of instant hot water.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater can fit in those tight spaces and still give you endless hot water. Tank water heaters are available in two variants- gas and electric. Water heaters are one of the most essential plumbing appliances in any home, and Four Seasons Plumbing provides high-efficiency water heater installation services to ensure that your family will always have access to clean, hot water. So if you can handle the high initial costs, you can save more money in the long run by switching to tankless.</p>
<p>If your water system has a check valve or anti-siphon valve on the supply line, an expansion tank near the cold intake to the heater will likely be necessary. Most smaller units are installed near the point of usage, usually on the wall. Overall, the tankless gas water heaters are not as dangerous to life as the comparable standard tank-type units, although nothing is ever 100% assured. Don't think that your heater will continue to function perfectly for many decades, regardless of how modern and expensive yours is. Hot water heater can go for many years without needing repair, but they always eventually malfunction and need fixing or replacing.</p>
