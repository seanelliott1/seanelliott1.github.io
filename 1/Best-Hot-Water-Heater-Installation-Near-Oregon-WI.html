<p>There's never a good time to run out of hot water—especially if you're halfway through a shower. Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>Your water heater is responsible for providing hot water to your faucets, showers, laundry, dishwasher and a multitude of other appliances.

If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
