Hot water heaters come in all shapes and sizes, some fueled by natural gas or oil, some by electricity or propane. If these tanks are replaced with tankless hot water heaters, newfound space can be converted into another resident amenity, such as on-site storage or laundry, both of which can bring in extra revenue. Most heaters are not sold with these jackets in place so a lot of heat can be lost through the tanks body.</p>
