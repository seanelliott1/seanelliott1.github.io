<h2>Water Heater Services Irwin Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Hot water heater problems can occur any time. It is important to know what you are looking for and what your capabilities are when attempting to deal with any hot water heater repair.

Changing to a tankless system like the Tempra® eliminates these problems and results in typical savings of at least 15 - 20% on the hot water portion of your electric bill. Never attempt to do it without first reading all the instructions that can with your particular tankless water heater. While you can help prolong the life of your water heater with annual maintenance, chances are you'll need to have the pre-existing tank replaced with a new one if you occupy a given residence for more than eight years.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>

<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>

<p>Be careful to ensure that your water heater is convenient and safe in case of future servicing. Remember, with tankless, there is no preheated reservoir of water. Once you close the hot water tap, the unit senses that the flow of water has stopped and shuts off the heating element. Get up to 36 months to pay for your new water heater, subject to credit approval. Condensing water heaters have a tank like a conventional storage tank water heater, but they capture hot exhaust gases that would normally be expelled from a home out the flue.</p>
<p>The benefits to installing tankless water heaters are numerous, but it's important to choose the right tankless water heater for your needs. Don't be shy about asking a retailer why the tankless water heater is discounted. So, over the typical duration of a unit, it will be a lot more efficient than a conventional tank-based heater. Once the old heater is done draining disconnect the gas pipe at the union fitting.</p>
<p>The most common types of traditional and tankless water heaters seen in residential settings are either electric or gas-powered products. The first step of installing a new water heater is to detach the existing one. Residential and commercial property owners who are wanting to update their water heaters typically go with tank water heaters. Whether you are building a new home or you are looking to install a more efficient water heater for your residential or commercial project, choosing the right system is important.</p>
