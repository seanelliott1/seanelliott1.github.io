<h2>Water Heater Services Chapel Hill North Carolina</h2>
<p>Water Heaters are a necessary household appliance that supplies all of your warm water needs, from cooking to bathing. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often. We also want enough hot water for our needs and energy costs savings. Many people don't know much about water heaters or water heater repairs. A well-maintained tankless water heater can last for a long time. Typical anticipated lifetimes for these water heaters are 8-12 years for conventional and 10-15 years for high-efficiency.</p>
<p>If you have a warranty of 12 to 15 years, which is typical, it doesn't make financial sense to replace a tank water heater with a tankless,” says Banta. Often an emergency, like a leaking water tank, is the reason a water heater is replaced. The Service Company Plumbing & Drains team is experienced in handling all types of water heater repair or replacement issues and can often have your hot water heater repaired or a new water heater installation completed same day in most cases.</p>
<p>An especially significant motivation is the 50% reduced heating costs over using a hot water tank. If you got a water heater that only worked for two people, it's not going to work as well when there are four to 10 people working or living in space. If you already have a booster installed in your home, we are also a water heater booster repair company and we service boosters as well. Whining noises indicate sediment has built up on the heating element and will cause lower water temperatures.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Repair Chapel Hill</h3>
<p>The tankless technology reduces homes energy consumption and lowers your energy bills as well. If your bank account can manage the higher initial cost of a tankless water heater, you'll save more money over time by choosing tankless. Open the water valves but not the electricity or gas. The type of water heater you choose directly affects your water heating costs. If you've had issues with hot water supply for as long as you've had the heater, your water heater's tank might not be big enough to supply the hot water you need.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>Many people are going towards getting tankless water heat so that they do not need to keep it maintained of another appliance. Energy Efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water, using about 35% less energy than a tank water heater. While it's true that the T&P Valve is likely to leak after testing it, the danger involved if it failed makes the risk of a leak worth it. If you want to see what could potentially happen due to a failed T&P, just Google "water heater blast" and check out the video at the website of that name.</p>
<p>On more recent water heaters, the combustion chamber may be sealed. This matters since it would require more power to heat colder water. There can be huge variances in what different gas fitters charge for hot water system installation cost. If this happens, you should reduce the demand for hot water by limiting simultaneous applications, and you may want to consider resetting your unit. Traditional tank water heaters take up valuable space in a basement, attic or closet—space you could use.</p>

They only heat the water as it's needed, unlike storage tank water heaters that require continuous maintenance of the temperature of the water in the tank.</p>

Although installation costs are higher, heat pump water heaters cost less to run over the longer term. Rinnai® tankless water heater technology gives you hot water in seconds, not minutes. Tankless heaters cost about $1,000 to $3,000.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the types of water heaters available before you make a decision. You can also save money on the purchase price of a new hot water system replacement, as the WELS water saving shower head help reduce the hot water installation size and cost of the hot water system required.
