The plumbers at Ben Franklin Levittown can also recommend the precise replacement heater needed for your water heater based on how many people live in your home within the budget you set. Our specialists can install, repair, tune-up, or replace any hot water heater. This saves energy, but could also waste water.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
