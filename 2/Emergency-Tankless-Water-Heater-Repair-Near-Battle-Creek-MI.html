<p>2. You can decide to replace it when you get discolored or tainted water when you turn on the hot tap. For homes with high daily water demands, multiple tankless heaters can be installed. Also, since tank-style heaters have been around longer and are more common, more professionals are capable of installing them and the labor costs are lower.

<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>

These provide the same amount of heat but spread out over a larger surface area, which lowers the surface temperature, making them less prone to mineral buildup. Keep a distance of 24″ between the combustibles, the water heater, and the output hot water pipe. Colder climates mean colder incoming groundwater temperature, resulting in a need for more energy to heat the water to your desired temperature.</p>

Electric tankless: Electric tankless heaters are relatively small in size.
