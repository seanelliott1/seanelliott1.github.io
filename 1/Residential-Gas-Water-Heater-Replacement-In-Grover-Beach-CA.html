<p>A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). Now that you've read up on how to drain your water heater, be sure the gas is turned off at the valve, not just at the control module. VIP Plumbing's prompt, courteous, and professional service technicians will fix all of your plumbing problems, and put your mind at ease. Because the old style had a tank full of water, every time the water in the tank drops below a certain temperature, the heating element turns on, heating the water back up, even if you aren't using it. With an inline heater, it only comes on when in use, and when you aren't using the hot water, the unit shuts off until needed again.</p>
<p>Save money, improve efficiency of your heating system with our professional water heater and tankless water heater installation and repair services. They do require a storage tank, unlike conventional tankless water heaters, but because an indirect heater uses the boiler or main furnace to heat the fluid circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank, the energy that's actually "stored" by the tank lets the furnace turn off and on less frequently.</p>
<p>The good news is that by deciding to do it yourself, you will be saving anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500 in installation costs. Depending on the weather and other components, you have several selections for powering your new water heater.

<p>Gas water heater: Connect the gas line to the gas burner control valve. A conventional gas water heater is a tried-and-tested system designed to keep your home's hot water running. You can control the output temperature directly on the tankless water heater, so you know how hot the water is delivered to your taps will be. Tankless heaters have become popular due to their many benefits. They both use an insulated storage tank jacket made of steel, with insulation between the storage tank and the tank jacket to reduce heat loss of the heated water.</p>
<p>When installing an exterior model you need to insulate the pipelines. A direct vent water heater is basically a sealed unit that has either two pipes or a concentric pipe pipe within pipe to suck in fresh air from outside the bathroom and also dispense exhaust gases outside. Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
