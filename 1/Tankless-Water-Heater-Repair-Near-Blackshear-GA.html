Electric water heater: Turn off the circuit breaker on the water heater's circuit at the home's breaker box. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, produce hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>

A tankless water heater will save you money since it provides instant heating when hot water is needed rather than constantly heating and reheating the same water until it is used.

Cycling losses - the loss of heat as the water circulates through a water heater tank, or inlet and outlet pipes.</p>
<p>TIP: Turn your water heater off two hours in advance to allow the water to cool. Gauging an everyday tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater.

<p>But likewise, even though the problem may be similar, the repair solution is considerably different from a traditional tank heater. We'll consider whether you prefer gas or electric service, how much hot water your property demands, and how much available space you have for a new tank. Many a times, water heaters start with a slow leak at the base or around a corroded fitting, that is when you really need to get it checked.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time.

<p>We offer a diverse range of water heaters, brands and sizes because we know how important it is to find a custom solution that satisfies the unique circumstances of your household. The venting system, for a gas heater, must be fully intact and functioning to ensure that poisonous gases are released outside the home. Tankless units are smaller and take up less space than traditional tank models. There are 2 options when it comes to venting a tankless water heater; direct and power venting.</p>
<p>Some people have certain preferences for what type of heater they buy, but other people have more practical reasons for the choice of what they choose to purchase. With many water pipes hooking to your heater and home's plumbing systems, you could cause more damage than good if you accidentally unscrew the wrong pipe. Even if you aren't sure which type of water heater is best for you, we can evaluate your current plumbing system, hot water usage, and help determine which type of heater you need.</p>
<p>Electric tankless models may require an upgrade of the home's electrical capacity. These units also require tankless water heater replacement less frequently than traditional units. We can service the vast majority of water heater makes and models. The gas-fired type works very much the same as the electric heater in terms of sensing water flow and instantly heating it.
