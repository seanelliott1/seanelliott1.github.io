<h2>Water Heater Services Norwich New York</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you.

<p>The small device can be installed underneath a sink on the wall where hot and cold water supply lines are accessible.
