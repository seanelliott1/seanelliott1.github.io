<h2>Water Heater Services Lenexa Kansas</h2>

The whole house tankless water heaters we sell come with advanced safety features that include an emergency shut off. Now with competitive electric power in some areas a 99 percent efficient tankless electric could really be your best tankless hot water heater.</p>
<p>The size of the water heater must also be taken into account. Tankless: As their name implies, tankless, or on-demand water heaters, don't store water in a tank. No matter what your needs are surrounding tankless water heaters, we'll help you meet them and get the hot water you need. Heating systems harness electric or even solar energy. This means inspecting the water pipes connected to the water heater, cleaning any debris and dust, checking the thermostats and safety valves and flushing the system.</p>
<p>If you already have a tankless water heater, we can also perform necessary repairs and maintenance. Tankless hot water heater replacement estimates cannot be given over the phone. Rather they heat water as it passes through a series of coils in the unit. It involves removing the tank unit and replacing the venting and pipes with proper fittings and venting that is up to code for a tankless water heater. Finolex offer s a range of electric water heaters which are specially designed for Indian Bathrooms and kitchen.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair Lenexa</h3>
<p>We'll figure out what's wrong with your thermostat and determine if a repair or replacement is the better solution for you. In most cases, the savings are even more if the water heater is installed outside. It is unfortunate that not enough emphasis is placed on maintaining it on a regular basis, because your water heater is a truly vital device to modern living. Compare the cost of electricity consumed and the heating method.</p>
<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
<p>How they work: Tank water heaters typically hold between 20 and 80 gallons of hot water (around 120 degrees Fahrenheit) in a storage tank. If the incoming water pressure is above 150 psi a pressure reducing valve must be installed upstream of the heater. Here are the biggest benefits of installing a tankless water heater in your home. These systems are capable of providing your home with unlimited hot water, all while lowering your energy bills.</p>

<p>But in that time frame, it's almost certain some sort of repairs will be needed. For further ideas or if you want to learn more regarding tankless gas models, you can go online through the internet to explore the different sites. If your water heater is more than ten years old, often it's more cost-efficient to opt for replacement rather than repair when things go wrong. Electric water heaters look similar to their gas-fueled cousins.</p>
<p>The first thing to check is for any leaks or standing water near your water heater. If the pilot light is out, follow the instructions posted on the water heater or the details below here to relight the pilot light. Reconnect the wire that was removed from the heating element to perform the resistance check in the previous steps. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating costs.</p>
<p>The drain valve is located at the bottom of the water heater. And there are no large electrical power demands needed as with the electric heater. Not enough hot water may also mean that your water heater is on its last leg and needs to be replaced. With a tankless water heater you can eliminate this heat loss because the water is only heated when you need it. This can end up saving money on your monthly energy bill and conserve energy.</p>

<p>To avoid flooding from tank failure, Bill Smith Plumbing & Heating offers alarm and cold water shut-off valve options. Our experienced technicians are equipped and trained for electric water heater repair. When you experience water heater problems, it's worth considering whether repair or replacement is the best solution. Traditional water heaters work by heating and storing a set amount of water in a tank. Turning on hot water throughout the home activates the heater, even if the pilot light is not on, so you are able to check the pipes for leaks much more easily.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home. However, a broken thermostat can also tip the water temperature in the opposite direction and can mean that your hot water gets way too hot. If you hear odd sounds when you use your shower, you should contact your water heater repair contractor because something is seriously wrong with the heater.</p>
<p>By the third bucket, if the water from your heater is still coming out rusty, then most likely the water heater (not the piping) is at fault. We needed a new water heater, installed the end of May. Likewise, if the existing wiring in your home cannot adequately supply electricity to your tankless water heater, there is a small chance that the wiring could short, which could potentially start an electric fire.</p>
<p>Plumbers typically charge $45 to $65 an hour and can usually install a water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours. Everyone is talking about on demand” these days, but the buzz has moved well beyond movies and videos and into the world of plumbing with the increasing popularity of tankless water heaters. The heater will proceed to release water into the container. Another benefit of tankless water heaters is that they last about 5-10 years longer than traditional systems before requiring replacement.</p>
