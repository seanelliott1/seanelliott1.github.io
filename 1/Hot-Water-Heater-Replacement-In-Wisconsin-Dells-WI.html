We sell a complete line of gas and electric hot water heaters from top manufacturers like Rheem, Bradford White, Bosch, State, Reliance, Noritz and A. Smith.

A properly installed tankless heater can certainly save a large amount of energy over a traditional water heater. A cold shower is a sure sign that your Gwinn home needs water heater maintenance.</p>
<p>Water is leaking from the hot water heater tank. However, as long as your water usage at any given time is below the maximum allowable flow rate, tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water. This is often provided by either a flame, on a gas water heater, or a heating element, on an electric water heater. They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>
<p>This helps ensure that your new hot water heater is installed properly and will provide you and your residents and employees with years of hot water. Thermostatic control, which is the ability of the tankless water heater to modulate power output and give a consistent temperature, is also important, especially for those people on wells. We'll take care of any retrofitting that needs to be performed and get your new tankless water heater dialed in for maximum efficiency.</p>

In most cases, a plumber will install a water heater in a day (6-8 hours). A lot of homeowners choose a tank-type water heater - a large, cylindrical tank standing on end with pipes attached to it.</p>
<p>It takes a good amount of time for the tank to fill back up, turn on the burner, and heat the water. In a gas based tankless system, the gas heater is responsible for heating the water. If you answered no” to one or more of these questions, especially, question #1, you should probably hold off and stick with a tank-style heater. We can relocate your water heater if needed. After you are sure that everything is connected back properly, open the valve to fill the tank up, while this is happening i would open up a few hot water faucets just to get some of the air out.</p>
<p>Cold climate tankless water heaters may require extra labor to install. Energy isn't wasted heating water that can sit in a tank for hours or days. The tank water heater has been the primary mode of heating water for decades now and this method of water heating has gone unchallenged, until now. One of the biggest risks with tank-style heaters is, over time, minerals from hard water build-up within the tank which leads to corrosion and eventually leaks.</p>
