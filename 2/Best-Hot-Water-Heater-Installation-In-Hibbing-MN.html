For larger households that use more than 86 gallons of hot water each day, tankless systems can be up to 14% more energy efficient than traditional water heaters.</p>

<p>Before you get a new water heater, you'll want to determine which system best meets your family's demands.

<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>The process is more intensive than your standard water heater replacement. A home's water heater affects both the comfort level in the shower and bath, as well as the monthly utility bill. Here at bluefrog Plumbing + Drain of Orange County, we help homeowners realize the potential of their water heater systems each day. When choosing a new tankless water heater for your Medina-area home, there are numerous factors to consider, including type, capacity, efficiency, and cost.</p>
