<h2>Water Heater Services Grand Junction Colorado</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we offer a solution that will meet your needs and conserve energy. This means that you might need a larger unit or multiple units if you have a simultaneous demand from multiple showers, faucets, or other hot water consumers like a washing machine. At Care Temp, LLC, we install and repair standard and tankless water heaters in Toms River, NJ, as well as in Brick, Jackson, Manchester, Lakewood, and the surrounding areas.</p>

There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater. Many storage tank water heaters take longer to heat water, because of the larger volume of water they must heat, than most tankless types.

Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size.
