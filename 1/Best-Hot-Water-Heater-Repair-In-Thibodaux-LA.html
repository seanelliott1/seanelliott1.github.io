<p>The tankless water heater must be able to deliver this maximum flow rate at the desired temperature rise. With the amount of money you'll save on energy costs, reduced maintenance requirements, and longer-lasting nature of these systems, you'll enjoy safer and more reliable warm water for longer, which keeps more money in your pocket where it belongs. For instance, less natural resources go into the manufacturing of these compact size heaters.</p>
<p>Hot water tanks typically last an average of 10 years, with variables like the condition of your water supply and frequency of preventative maintenance playing significant roles in your system's useful life. A water heater that's right for you. Connect with dedicated hoses the hot water outlet and the cold water inlet via the pressure relief valve. While your choice of water heater will cause a greater or lesser upfront cost, over time this will all average out to where you end up paying about the same over five years.</p>

<p>Typically, you'll have a choice between gas, electric, tankless, and even solar-powered water heaters.

<p>TIP: Turn your water heater off two hours in advance to allow the water to cool. Gauging an everyday tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater.
