On average, a replacement electric hot water heater installation price would be around $550 for labour and fittings only, for a simple change out.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>Switching from electric to gas will add about $900 to the cost of hot water system installation.

Please be aware that uninstalled units returned due to a home that has inadequate electrical service may subject to a re-stocking fee.</p>

<p>The majority of Houston homes use tank water heaters. Ensure that children can't reach the electrical sub-panel, outlet water pipes. Install your black iron gas piping with a shut-off valve and a dirt leg at the water heater. If someone is not home to turn off the water to the water heater when it fails, flooding is a distinct possibility. Modern water heaters are more efficient than older units, provide consistent hot water for more extended periods, and save you more money on your monthly bill.</p>
