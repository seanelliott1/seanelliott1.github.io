<p>Admittedly, your old water heater is one of the biggest contributors to that high energy bill, and replacing it could mean considerable savings. Tankless water heaters have become increasingly popular due to their efficiency and compact size. Several smaller units cannot produce enough hot water for simultaneous purposes in large families.

<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused.
