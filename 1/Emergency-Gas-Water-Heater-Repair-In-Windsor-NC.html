<p>Tankless heaters are also small and use significantly less space than a large tank water heater. They also lose only 5 percent of their energy compared with a tank unit's 30 percent energy loss. By contrast, installing a conventional electric water heater is within your reach… Provided that you possess some experience in plumbing and electricity. Because the tankless water heater is going to only give the hot water as it is needed instead of having it sit in the tank all the time waiting for you to use it. Then you will not need to worry about having any one getting burnt because they were messing around the hot water tank when they should have not been.</p>
<p>Ensure to flush the water heater tank once every year. But if you're building a new home or adding to an existing one, installing a tankless water heater may make economic sense. If one of them isn't working, you'll still get hot water but it won't be as much as you're used to. Leaving the issue unresolved will ultimately result in the second heating element not working as well. And when soldering or welding, remember to flush the pipes before connecting them to the water heater and that excess heat can cause damage to the unit.</p>
<p>While an electric tankless water heater is going to take up much less room than a conventional water heater, you need to follow some other installation protocols.

Entrusting your water heater service needs to Always Plumbing Services also allows you to focus your time and efforts on more important priorities.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. As shown in the photo, a tankless water heater has its components housed in a steel box that's designed to be mounted on the wall. This means as long as you have water flowing, and don't run out of whatever fuel (propane, electricity, etc.) you use to generate the heat; you have continuous hot water.</p>

Cycling losses - the loss of heat as the water circulates through a water heater tank, or inlet and outlet pipes.</p>
<p>2. Electrical tankless water heaters can require upgraded electrical service of much higher amperage than you currently have. When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>
<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size.
