This will also cause the water heater to work harder to heat the remaining water inside the tank because it is losing hot water through the leak. One has to carefully evaluate their need and usage along with the cost factor before purchasing them considering that this is one time investment as the tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of about 20 years.</p>
