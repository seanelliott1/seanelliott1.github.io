<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through.

<p>Propane is available as both traditional tank water heaters starting at $560, and tankless products beginning around $600, other options include a single, wall-mounted, tankless, 1.5 GPM shower unit with a battery powered igniter and a showerhead for approximately $110.

Another way is to heat water as it passes through the pipes -tankless heaters work this way.</p>
