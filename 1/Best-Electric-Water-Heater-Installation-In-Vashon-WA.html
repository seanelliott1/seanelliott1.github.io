<h2>Water Heater Services Vashon Washington</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>1. Tankless water heaters require regular ongoing maintenance in order to run at their best efficiency. This requires a great deal of energy and puts incredible strain on the unit, which is why storage water heaters wear out after only eight to 12 years. In addition, SETS tankless water heaters are the only systems that offer a 100% lifetime parts replacement warranty. The downside is that, if you have multiple showers running at the same time, tankless water heaters are not able to keep up. This isn't just a problem with showers, depending on the size of your water heater, you can run into issues by having a shower and the dishwasher running at the same time.</p>
