<h2>Water Heater Services Whiteland Indiana</h2>
<p>Let's face it, unless you have invested in the new state-of-the-art tankless systems, water heaters take up a lot of space. The less water you use, the more efficient your tankless water heater will be. That's why these systems are ideal for vacation homes and families that use less water. Replaced 75 gallon electric water heater with rheem 75 gallon Marathon with a lifetime warranty. Most homeowners don't give much thought to the water heater until it goes out. Age - The serial number on the water heater should also contain the date of manufacture, which will give you the heater's age.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement Whiteland</h3>
<p>Tankless heaters are also small and use significantly less space than a large tank water heater. They also lose only 5 percent of their energy compared with a tank unit's 30 percent energy loss. By contrast, installing a conventional electric water heater is within your reach… Provided that you possess some experience in plumbing and electricity. Because the tankless water heater is going to only give the hot water as it is needed instead of having it sit in the tank all the time waiting for you to use it. Then you will not need to worry about having any one getting burnt because they were messing around the hot water tank when they should have not been.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters assist in reducing the energy consumption within your home by not having to heat water in storage tanks that goes unused. Longer Lifespan: Generally, a tankless system will last a lot longer than the water heaters with tanks, because they're not in constant contact with water. This problem can be solved by using a demand hot water pump, which in combination with the tankless heater can get your hot water to you at less than half the time it would take running the faucet full blast, and the pump doesn't run water down the drain, so you save not only time, but water as well.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: When properly maintained each year, a tankless water heater can potentially last multiple decades before replacement. 2. As mentioned earlier, you have to check the type of water heater you have. That's where WeatherMakers comes in. Our experienced, courteous plumbers will answer your emergency call, perform regular maintenance and tune-ups, install a new tankless water heater or hot water tank, or replace your unit when it's time.</p>
<p>We provide FREE in-home Energy Consultations to evaluate your current system and help you choose the best water heater for your home. Hooking your tankless heater up to a solar system yields the best energy savings and reduces water heating expenses by 50%-80%. The Rinnai line of tankless hot water heaters feature indoor and outdoor models. But if you don't have a gas line into the house and have to use an electric unit, existing wiring may have to be upgraded.</p>
<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Whiteland IN</h3>
<p>Our technicians are thoroughly trained on nearly every brand, make and model of water heater you may have in your home, so that we can effectively assess the issues at hand and address them immediately. Your hot water heater doesn't have to be a behemoth. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.</p>
<p>In addition, you will benefit from adjusting your hot water temperature with the changing seasons to get the right temperature from the faucets. Manufacturers recommend that certified electricians or plumbers install tankless water heaters. Traditional electric hot water heater tanks take up as much as 16 square feet of floor space in your home, but a tankless water heater is very compact and can be fixed on almost any wall either inside or outside your home.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble with your existing water heater, schedule an in-home consultation and let one of our professional, licensed technicians inspect your unit. Tankless water heaters are far more efficient because they do not waste energy keeping water hot when there is no demand for it. Maintaining the temperature of a 50-gallon tank of water takes a lot of gas or electricity that is not needed with the in-demand style of water heaters.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Whiteland Indiana 46184</h3>
<p>While traditional water heaters will typically have a lifespan of anywhere between ten and fifteen years, most tankless units can be expected to be in use for over twenty years. The tank is heavy, so you will probably want to have some very strong rope so that you can lower the old water heater down and raise the new one up. Our tankless water heater maintenance plans can make this easier, more convenient and less expensive to do while offering you priority service as a maintenance plan member.</p>
<p>Maintenance: periodic water heater maintenance is recommended by the Department of Energy and will vary greatly based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but expect to pay standard hourly plumber fees of $45-$65 an hour for water heater maintenance, with most maintenance taking 1 to 2 hours for a yearly total of $45 to $130. Installed 50 gallon electric water heater and thermal expansion tank. Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning can help you use less hot water and lower water heating costs with ENERGY STAR-rated models, adding low-flow fixtures and consulting with you on other energy-efficiency upgrades.</p>
<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter's water heater comparison guide is a great starting point to familiarize yourself with what's out there. This is a sign that the water heater will need a repair visit soon. This is particularly true in cold weather climates: If the ground water being pumped into the tankless system is already very cold, it will take longer to heat up than a traditional system. Electric water heaters use electricity to heat water.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
