<h2>Water Heater Services Dunedin Florida</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>The recommended water heater setting of about 115-120 degrees, it keeps your water heater from overheating and save a lot of electricity. Trying to install a water heater yourself can be dangerous and end up costing more than hiring a professional. All forms of flammable material must be kept far away from the heater, while construction components hidden in the wall like wooden supports must be properly insulated from heat in order not to weaken or even ignite as the heater is used over time.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
<p>Depending on your household size and personal energy-saving goals, a tankless water heater may be right for you. It is never recommended that you attempt to replace a gas or electric water heater if you are not specifically trained to do so. Improper installation of water heaters may cause fire or explosion.

First of all, it is important to understand the basic operation of a tankless water heater. New storage tank water heaters are required to operate more efficiently, and tankless (on-demand) water heaters are even more efficient than that. This indicates what sort of energy source is used to heat the water.</p>
<p>Electric units face even bigger changes. A tankless heater is not effective when more than two tasks are drawing from it. So it should be one at a time. This valve is supposed to shut off the water heater's heating element once the water reaches a certain pressure.

Whether you are building a new home or you are looking to install a more efficient water heater for your residential or commercial project, choosing the right system is important.</p>
