<h2>Water Heater Services Southern Pines North Carolina</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
