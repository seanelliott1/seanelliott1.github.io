<h2>Water Heater Services Rockville Maryland</h2>
<p>Ever ponder how to install a tankless water heater? As far as durability and lifespan is concerned, storage tank lasts for 5-7 years while instant heating system has a lifespan of 3 - 5 years. The tankless unit usually hangs on the wall and is about the size of your circuit breaker or fuse box. A properly installed tankless water heater can last twice as long as a hot water tank. Breaker size and wire gauge must meet all applicable local, state, provincial, and national electrical codes for your area - these are only guidelines that will apply to most installations.</p>
<p>We've been working in and around the Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo area for over 20 years, and in that time have refined our services to become the best. If however, the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat, the lower thermostat switches "on" and sends voltage to the lower heating element (a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be "calling") and heats the water.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself. Another sort of water heater pumps the heat around the plumbing system, while an indirect water heater heats the water through the house's general heating system. No matter your reason for choosing a tankless version, you can rest assured that our fully licensed contractors have the knowledge, skills, and resources to complete your tankless water heater installation quickly and efficiently.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair Rockville</h3>
<p>By nature of the design, the Tempra® is nearly 100% efficient; converting 100% of the electrical energy it consumes into heat. When a hot water faucet is turned on, water flows through the tankless water heater. The burners can become dirty and clogged, which will cause them to have trouble firing, and you'll notice this by a drop in hot water temperature in the house. This thorough video, by Ron Hazelton, explains how a failing conventional water heater can cause debris in your water that clogs faucet aerators, shower heads, and other water-using devices.</p>
<p>If you're starting to see the signs below, it's time to think about replacing your water heater. This is largely due to the increased amount of energy required to operate a tankless heater when it's in use. Some state laws require replacement water heaters to be anchored or braced to resist movement during an earthquake, which can cause gas or water line leaks and electrical wiring damage. If your household consumes a great deal of hot water and needs it from more than one outlet at a time then don't purchase a standard tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Get endless on-demand hot water, space savings, eco-efficiency and peace of mind from the world's most reliable tankless gas water heater brand. If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas coming from its location, you have a potentially dangerous situation on your hands. In electric water heaters, if hot water comes out for a very short span of time, the first thing to check is the thermostat setting. No storage or holding tank means that tankless water heaters have a life span twice as long as traditional systems because the risk of rust and corrosion is significantly lower.</p>
<p>The first thing you'll have to decide when looking at hot water heaters is what type of fuel source you want yours to use. The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>

Tankless water heaters that use natural gas are about 23 percent more efficient than a traditional storage version, which is about 60 percent efficient, according to the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Lower temperatures have also been proven to make your tankless gas water heater last longer because less minerals and corrosion will build up. Consider insulating your water heater pipes as well, especially if the water is traveling three feet or more from the unit's location. The approach is consistent for tankless water heaters.

Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment.
