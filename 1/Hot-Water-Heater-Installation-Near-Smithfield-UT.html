Our services for water heater installation also span across Bristol, Abington, Montgomery County, Bucks County, Levittown, Newtown, Bala Cynwyd, Yardley, Colmar, Doylestown, New Hope, and Upper Darby, PA.

Tank-type natural gas hot water heaters use ½” gas lines, while tankless hot water heaters require ¾” gas lines.

Also, contact your city or town for information about obtaining a permit, if necessary, and about local water heater installation codes.</p>

Loud pops or cracks indicate that the heating element is failing and needs to be replaced.</p>
