<h2>Water Heater Services Wheat Ridge Colorado</h2>
<p>Most water heaters cannot last for a lifetime. Tankless water heaters are gaining popularity with homeowners in Scottsdale, AZ. At Affordable Plumbing, Rooter and Water Heaters, we specialize in providing homeowners efficient options for their water heating needs. Unlike conventional water heaters, which may hold 40 to 50 gallons of hot water ready at all times, tankless water heaters save energy by producing hot water only when needed. Replacement or installation of shutoff valves for water and gas.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>
<p>Sometimes water heaters cannot be repaired or it makes more sense to replace them after they have exceeded their expected service life.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Wheat Ridge</h3>

Tankless water heaters do not store water but heat the water you use directly as you need it. These tanks operate on either gas or electricity and are activated only when hot water is required. In many cases, cooler weather may result in the heater having to work harder to maintain the same temperature that it did in the warmer months.</p>
<p>It only needs enough power to heat the amount of water needed at the time. A water heater is not only useful for your bath but also for your laundry, dishwashing etc. Replacement of a traditional water tank is usually needed because of the build-up of scale and rust on the inside of the tank. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently ready. While traditional water heaters maintain a constant supply of hot water for your use, a tankless unit heats water quickly on demand.</p>
<p>In such cases, our Thousand Oaks water heater repair professionals will explain to you why replacing your old water heater will be cheaper in the long run than repairing it time and time again. Our technicians have specialized training in tankless systems, which means we can address the areas of installation, repair, and replacement with equal confidence.

The question of are tankless water heaters worth it is a question of balancing the long-term and short-term costs of different types of heaters. The latest technology can be found in the on demand water heaters. In addition, water damage due to poor maintenance of your home isn't covered.</p>

Aside from the biggest one, enjoying a limitless supply of hot water on-demand, a tankless water heater can even help you save money and prepare your home for changes that may happen in the future. His creation allowed water to be heated and stored in a metal tank until a demand was placed on it.</p>

It does this through a design of super-heated coils. If your water heater is leaking or isn't heating your water well enough, call today. Draining the water heater is easy but be sure to get it started first since it will take a while to drain off and no one wants to carry water heater up a flight of stairs while there's still water in it. It makes it heavy and will more than likely create a mess along the way.</p>
<p>These systems are also sometimes called on-demand water heaters because they only heat water when there is an immediate need for it. So there is no energy being wasted to maintain a tank of hot water that might not be used for hours, days, or even weeks if you are not at home. On the positive side, and despite the sticker-shock price tag, a tankless heater may be the best solution in a remote or infrequently used location.</p>
