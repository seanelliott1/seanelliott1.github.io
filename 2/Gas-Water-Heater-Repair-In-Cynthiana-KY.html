<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Installation Cynthiana</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>Ensure to flush the water heater tank once every year. But if you're building a new home or adding to an existing one, installing a tankless water heater may make economic sense. If one of them isn't working, you'll still get hot water but it won't be as much as you're used to. Leaving the issue unresolved will ultimately result in the second heating element not working as well. And when soldering or welding, remember to flush the pipes before connecting them to the water heater and that excess heat can cause damage to the unit.</p>
<p>Touch red probe to the power screw terminal of heating element and black probe to the power screw terminal of thermostat. If these stops don't lead to hot water, it's time to either check the heating element in an electric water heater or the burner unit and gas control valve in a gas-powered heater. Mechanical Systems Expertise: To install and service water heaters, mechanical systems know-how is a must. We paid $570 (electric) and $600 (gas) for the two 50-gallon Rheem tank water heaters we tested, but we have seen tank water heaters priced for less at home improvement stores.</p>

<p>2. Electrical tankless water heaters can require upgraded electrical service of much higher amperage than you currently have. When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>

<p>A variety of water heaters use electricity, including lowboy heaters and heat pump hybrid heaters. Again we highly recommend having Hunts take care of your hot water tank repairs needs for you safety and piece of mind knowing you job was done by a pro. This will save you so much time and money. Tankless water heater, as the stated in the name, is the kind of water heating system that provides hot water without using a tank.</p>
<p>The basic premise behind a tankless heater is that the water is not forced to stay within a tank, being heated and reheated until it's used.

If you are switching from electric to LPG gas hot water system the gas hot water heater installation cost would typically be in the $1200 to $3000 range.</p>
<p>Your water heater is leaking: Any type of water leak is no good, but it can be especially bad if the water is coming from your water heater. Most water heaters rely on a natural draft to draw combustion fumes up the flue. Turn off the cold water valve at the top of the heater. Disconnect the pipes and remove the water heater. Since everyone will have a slightly unique situation in reconnecting their water heater, let me just offer you some tips and lists that will help you to determine your best approach.</p>
<p>Once the heating elements fry, it usually costs about as much to replace the entire heater as it does to swap in new elements. Basic routine maintenance such as draining your water heater will help eliminate any build up of sediment inside the tank. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we have an option that will match your needs and save energy. Age: As a rule, if your water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to invest in a new water heater. As soon you turn off the water flow, the heater turns off. The traditional water heater keeps water hot 24 hours a day even you are at work or sleeping. Most tank-style water heaters last about eight to 12 years.</p>
