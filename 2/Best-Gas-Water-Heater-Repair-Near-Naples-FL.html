<h2>Water Heater Services Naples Florida</h2>
<p>A tankless water heater provides water as it is needed. This saves you from needing to drain the entire water heater. While it's usually recommended to stick with a gas water heater if you're concerned about energy costs, it is possible to switch from a gas to an electric water heater in Las Vegas. We have a comprehensive selection of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in multiple sizes, all with excellent warranties and installation. Sure, I said it wasn't the only reason to make the change, but solar heaters are undoubtedly a wonderful green choice.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>Install the temperature and pressure relief valve (T&P) discharge pipe so that it flows down toward the discharge point. When debating which water to invest in or switch to, consider these alarming statistics about at-home water usage and the differences between all the water heaters on the market. When you rely on Clarke & Rush for tankless water heater repair or replacement, you can expect professional service from a skilled plumber.</p>

<p>Tankless heaters are also small and use significantly less space than a large tank water heater. They also lose only 5 percent of their energy compared with a tank unit's 30 percent energy loss. By contrast, installing a conventional electric water heater is within your reach… Provided that you possess some experience in plumbing and electricity. Because the tankless water heater is going to only give the hot water as it is needed instead of having it sit in the tank all the time waiting for you to use it. Then you will not need to worry about having any one getting burnt because they were messing around the hot water tank when they should have not been.</p>

<p>Either way, here are your primary water heating options. Note that the water heater should not share a circuit with another appliance—it draws too much power when heating. Tankless water heaters have been widely used in Europe and Japan for decades, and have become increasingly popular in North America as the Green Movement has gained traction. The direct vent tankless gas water heater is a bit different in that the combustion air comes directly from outside by way of a gas burner.</p>
