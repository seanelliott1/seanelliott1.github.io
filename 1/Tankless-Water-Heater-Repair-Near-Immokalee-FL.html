<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair Immokalee</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>

Age of the Heating Unit: The average life of a water heater is about 8 to 12 years.</p>
<p>Traditional storage water heaters. Less expensive to run - Because these systems only consume energy when there's a demand for hot water, they're more fuel efficient than storage systems, which must keep up a steady supply of heat to maintain water temperature. 1) I needed a unit big enough to supply me with hot water for at least one shower and sink running at the same time.
