Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters.

<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>
<p>Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's needed. Depending on the position of your water hookups, you may not be able to use the oversized water heater at all. Traditional water heaters come with up to a six-year warranty. These gases are blown through a coil in the base of the unit, where incoming cold water can absorb most of the heat.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how the tankless water heater has revolutionized the simple act of taking a hot bath. When that control is lost and your water heater fails, you are trapped with one option and one option only: enduring constant cold water.
