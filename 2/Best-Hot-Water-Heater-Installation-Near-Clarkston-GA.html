<h2>Water Heater Services Clarkston Georgia</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>The average tankless water heater repair costs $603. A traditional water heater will last up to 10-15 years in your home before it begins to lose efficiency. It's also important to clean out the sediment filter on the heater from time to time. Large households consume a lot of hot water, especially at peak times in the mornings and evenings. This also goes for replacing an old water heater. We offer quick same day service and stock most common water heater parts.</p>
<p>If LPG gas installation is required, including gas bottle installation, LPG installation cost would be in the $250 to $500 range, depending on the lengths of the pipe runs. The energy efficiency of the boiler or hot water tank storage system comes from the dual use, which reduces standing water heat loss and offsets electric energy use with natural gas. We perform all the water heater services you need, from installing a high-efficiency unit to keeping the appliance up and running for years to come.</p>

<p>Tankless heaters are also small and use significantly less space than a large tank water heater. They also lose only 5 percent of their energy compared with a tank unit's 30 percent energy loss. By contrast, installing a conventional electric water heater is within your reach… Provided that you possess some experience in plumbing and electricity. Because the tankless water heater is going to only give the hot water as it is needed instead of having it sit in the tank all the time waiting for you to use it. Then you will not need to worry about having any one getting burnt because they were messing around the hot water tank when they should have not been.</p>
<p>Electric tank-type heaters utilize electrical-resistance heating elements located within the hot water storage tank to heat up the water within the tank. There is no need for a storage tank nor is there any energy wasted on heat loss with the tankless heating systems. Hot water heaters heat up the water supplied by your friendly utilities company, allowing you to do things like luxuriate in hot, candle-lit bathtubs, wash beautiful bone china, and keep yourself in a steady supply of clean underwear.</p>
<p>However, if you're considering an electric tankless water heater, you'll need to make sure your home's electric panel can handle the added load.
