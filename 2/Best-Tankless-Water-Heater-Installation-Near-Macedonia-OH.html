Another feature found in Houston water heater tanks is a magnesium rod known as a sacrificial anode rod Corrosion and rust are primary reasons that most tank-type water heaters fail.</p>
<p>The average cost for a plumber to install a water heater is about $80 per hour. If the sacrificial anode rod is not replaced once it has been fully corroded, your hot water storage tank will begin to corrode, meaning you will probably have to replace it prematurely. One or both heating elements may have burned out and need replacing.
