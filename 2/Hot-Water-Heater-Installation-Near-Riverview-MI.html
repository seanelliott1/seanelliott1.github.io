Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
