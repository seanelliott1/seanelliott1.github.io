At Affordable Plumbing, Rooter and Water Heaters, we specialize in providing homeowners efficient options for their water heating needs.

Replacement or installation of shutoff valves for water and gas.</p>
<p>The tankless hot water heater will heat the water as it goes through the heat exchanger, which is activated by the incoming water as it flows through. Gas water heaters require gas lines that provide fuel to the ignition system and burner. If you are not experienced in maintaining a water heater, it is best to bring in a plumber to maintain it annually. Your perfect water heater will differ depending on your hot water expectations, your budget, and the layout of your home.</p>
<p>The truth behind the myth is that the only part of the water heater which necessitates replacement is a leak in the tank itself.

For this reason, installation costs will vary based on a home's floor plan and how far the piping needs to be directed through the house.</p>

<p>And don't miss out on our special offers on water heaters. Depending on your home and hot water demand, you may need to install a whole-home system one (or more) point-of-use units. This type of system absorbs heat from surrounding air and deposits it inside the water, achieving more than double the efficiency of standard water heating. When you're looking to replace your water heater, there is nothing more frustrating than chasing down contractors, wondering if they will show up, and being charged more than you had been led to believe.</p>
<p>If there is a similar problem with an electric tank-type water heater, no such explosion can occur. What it does is provide hot water on demand so you don't have to worry about the shower suddenly running cold. This water heater hangs on your wall and, instead of storing a large tank of water that is kept constantly hot-even when you're asleep or not at home-the tankless water heater produces hot water only when it's needed, as it's needed.</p>
<p>The process of heating the water is triggered when the tankless hot water heater senses the demand for hot water, which occurs when you turn on the hot water tap. In this case, the expanding water flows into the expansion tank rather than your pipes. Removal of a water heater requires the power source to be disconnected and the tank to be completely drained. Our energy saver installation service saves you time and energy.</p>
<p>Check with your plumbing contractor in Alpharetta whether you need permits for a new water heater. If you're considering tankless water heating or need service for an existing unit in Poquoson, Hampton, Gloucester, Newport News, Williamsburg or Isle of Wight, call Lighthouse Mechanical. Tankless water heaters yield many benefits compared to a traditional water heater. If you're experiencing any problems with your water heater, our professionals will be able to diagnose and solve the problems quickly and professionally.</p>
<p>Gas versions use a gas burner to heat up the water as it passed through the pipe, while an electric type uses a heating element. He decides to remove and replace his failing water heater with a tankless water heater, and walks us through the process. Beyond the initial cost, the national average for the installation of a tankless unit is slightly over $1,700. A problem one contractor might solve with an inexpensive replacement of a sacrificial anode could inspire another, less scrupulous contractor to solve by recommending a brand new (and expensive) water heater.</p>
