<h2>Water Heater Services Fairfax Virginia</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>

<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>

<p>Problems such as rusty or discolored water, strange noises or low or no heat are also indicators it's time to get your water heater repaired or replaced. A tankless water heater is also called an "on-demand" water heater, because it only heats water when you turn on the hot water tap. Tankless water heaters take up very little space because they have no capacity to store water; instead, cold water is piped through a heat exchanger and heated to a preset temperature range.</p>
