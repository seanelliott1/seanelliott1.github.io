<p>Water Heaters are a necessary household appliance that supplies all of your warm water needs, from cooking to bathing. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often. We also want enough hot water for our needs and energy costs savings. Many people don't know much about water heaters or water heater repairs. A well-maintained tankless water heater can last for a long time. Typical anticipated lifetimes for these water heaters are 8-12 years for conventional and 10-15 years for high-efficiency.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, installing a tankless system will be a good step at reducing your energy consumption and by just installing one, it will knock money off the utility bill. If it's a tankless water heater, we know how to repair it. All tankless units, regardless of the manufacturer, have similar issues and several common points of failure.

<p>Solar water heaters are efficient but expensive. If you purchase a tankless heater by a good brand such as Bosch, Kenmore or American Water Heater, it can last as long as 20 years without being repaired or replaced.

<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive.
