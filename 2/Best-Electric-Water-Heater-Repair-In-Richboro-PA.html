They're efficient, durable and 80 percent smaller than conventional hot water tanks. This means a newer installation is nearly guaranteed to provide quicker, more efficient, and more effective hot water delivery. Calculate the maximum simultaneous demand for hot water in the house, and you'll know which system(s) should be installed and where it should be located.</p>
<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit. Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment. Tankless water heater built with condensing technology has lower costs of installation.</p>
<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty. An undersized water heater may also be the problem if too much water is being used to heat it adequately.</p>
<p>Your water heater's heating elements and thermostat can also wear out, leaving you with a fluctuating temperature or no hot water at all. Leaks and drips, the pressure valve and even the pilot light going out are other common troubleshooting areas that hot water heaters may present, whether they're located in a commercial or residential facility. Wait a little while, then check the water temperature at a faucet.</p>
