<h2>Water Heater Services Camby Indiana</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit.
