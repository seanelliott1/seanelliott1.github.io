<p>Water is dripping constantly from the rag that you have wrapped around the pin hole in the water pipe. Install an additional tankless water heater to ensure you can always meet demand. Once your water heater stops working, you should know what to do, whether to apply a DIY approach or to go on and call a plumber. When you open a faucet, the released hot water is replaced by incoming cold water, which is heated and stored again at a temperature controlled by one or more thermostats in the tank. Having hot water and heat for your home is a must have.</p>
