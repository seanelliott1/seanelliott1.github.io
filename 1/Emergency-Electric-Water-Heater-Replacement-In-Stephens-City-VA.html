<p>Tankless water heaters are not a simple swap out.” Most conventional gas water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. No storage tank saves valuable space. The tankless heater compared to a conventional heater has unlimited hot water and can deliver for hours not limited by the tank's capacity.

<p>FYI - Some tankless units, such as those made by Rheem , are able to work with a standard ½-inch gas line, provided it isn't longer than 24 feet. A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater. In an instant water heater system, the water is already heated to the set temperature as it travels through the pipes. They heat water directly, delivering a continuous flow so you never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>Place the water heater in a drip pan made for this purpose if the equipment is located inside the home, and especially if it is in the attic. Increasingly, consumers are turning to tankless water heaters for their many benefits. Tankless units are susceptible to failure due to hard water. Just keep in mind that water heaters have a typical life span of 10 to 15 years. The tankless water heater only makes hot water when a faucet is opened and stops when the faucet is closed, which adds to your home's efficiency and overall operating costs.</p>
<p>Keep your water heater set to 120 degrees F as higher temperatures can increase sediment buildup in the tank. The next thing that you should consider if you are asking the question of when do you need a new water heater is the age of the system that you have in your home. Traditional tank water heaters can run on gas or electricity. Here at The Hot Water Company, we are taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and can actually serve our great customers without coming in contact with them at all, as most water heaters are located outside or in the garage.</p>

<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
