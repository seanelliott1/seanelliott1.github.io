<h2>Water Heater Services Warrenton North Carolina</h2>
<p>Installing a tankless gas water heater is a very worthwhile investment and one that will pay for itself in a very short period of time. Without a warranty, you could end up spending a lot more on repairs of an old water heater than you would if you upgraded to a new model. Some problems are rather inexpensive and some problems will require that a completely new water heater be installed. However, you also have to decide between these three tankless water venting systems: a direct vent system, a non-direct vent system, or an outdoor tankless system.</p>
<p>The average tankless water heater repair costs $603. A traditional water heater will last up to 10-15 years in your home before it begins to lose efficiency. It's also important to clean out the sediment filter on the heater from time to time. Large households consume a lot of hot water, especially at peak times in the mornings and evenings. This also goes for replacing an old water heater. We offer quick same day service and stock most common water heater parts.</p>
<p>Your water heater doesn't start up: A failure to ignite or to turn at all can indicate a number of problems with your water heater, from the thermostat to the electric ignition. Our Austin plumbers constantly receive calls from individuals who notice that their water heater might have a problem. If your electric water heater isn't working the first thing to do is check your breaker or fuse box. Furthermore, tankless systems last nearly twice as long as traditional water heaters - up to 20 years or more.</p>

<p>Gallons Per Minute (GPM) represents the amount of hot water a tankless water heater provides per minute. If the extra costs of installing a tankless system are going to outweigh your potential savings, you may want to consider a tank system or a high-efficiency tank system. Gas heaters are touted as being more economical and environmentally friendly than electric, but they also have more components that may wear out or fail.</p>
<p>The cost of hot water can be a determining factor when considering water heater repair versus water heater replacement. Very Efficient: Traditional water heaters use so much energy because they're constantly working to heat water - even when you're not home.
