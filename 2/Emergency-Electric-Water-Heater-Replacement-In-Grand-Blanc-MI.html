<h2>Water Heater Services Grand Blanc Michigan</h2>
<p>When choosing a tankless water heater to go with, you have to first decide between tankless electric water heaters and tankless gas water heaters. Missing and improperly installed T&P discharge pipes are a common problem. Before you disconnect and remove your existing water heater, be sure to do all of the necessary preparation—you don't want to be stuck without hot water for a week or two while you're waiting for needed plumbing, electrical, or vent work. While the water is draining out of the old heater, Unbox the new water heater.

<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>

<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons.

These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down.

Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>
<p>When you lose power, there is a reserve of hot water for a short time period. You have no hot water: If you don't have hot water in your home, your water heater clearly isn't working. If your water heater leaks around the base, is over 10 years old, works erratically or doesn't work at all at this point, it's probably time to replace it. If you aren't comfortable working with gas or electricity, do yourself a favor and call a professional plumber.</p>
