<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Antelope CA</h3>
<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create. This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>
<p>The inconvenience gets colder when repair costs are high or injuries occur. Unfortunately, things can happen whether it's because of the system or there was a lack of maintenance, a tankless water heater will eventually need repairs. Some systems are more efficient than the traditional heaters and will give reduced utility costs. Choosing a lower cost installer for the work of putting in your tankless water heater could end up costing you more because of a higher potential for substandard installation work—resulting in unnecessary, expensive repairs in the future.</p>
<p>You may have a short in the heating element or a thermostat problem. Tankless water heaters are typically more expensive than conventional models, with prices ranging from $600 to $2,000, plus installation; in comparison, a standard water heater runs between $300 and $1,000. If you have a leaky pipe attached to your water heater, make sure you turn the water off immediately to prevent further water damage. All John Moore water heater installations (except for Economy) come with a 13-year labor warranty.</p>

<p>Enjoy more hot water for less by replacing your water heater with a more reliable, energy-efficient Rheem unit. Improved Energy Efficiency: On average, tankless water heaters use 30 to 50% less energy, so you can start enjoying the cost savings of lower energy bills. So long as this pipe is in good condition, you will use it to connect to your new water tank. Next, shut off the water supply to the water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless water heating systems effectively cancels out the standby heat losses made by storage type heaters. However, in that 30 plus year span, it has been determined that tankless water heaters can be expected to last for 20 years or more with minimal care and maintenance being required. While these units will similarly fuel your system, the main differences occur in operating cost. Plumbers are pros at fitting pipes and stopping leaks, but that doesn't mean they can troubleshoot electrical problems, adjust gas pressures, or monitor combustion safety.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a tankless water heater, you will need to determine your hot water usage, which is measured in gallons per minute (GPM), and figure out your maximum hot water demand. Whether you go with an electric tankless unit or a gas one, you will save money on your utility bills. In some cases, a tankless water heater is located in a completely different location than the old water heater. If you have a tankless coil water heater, and you heat with oil, follow steps for "no heat." If you have a gas hot water tank, do not reset breaker or re-light pilot.</p>

Not only do we offer water heater repair for your home or business, but we also install water heaters, as well.</p>
