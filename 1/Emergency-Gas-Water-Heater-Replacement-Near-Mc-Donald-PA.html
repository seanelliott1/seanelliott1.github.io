<p>When your hot water heater breaks, you will know that something isn't right when there is no hot water coming from your faucets. By heating water on demand, no water tank was necessary. There are things you can buy to get around this issue, but for the most part, the tankless water heater is only going to generate heat when it's needed. Storage tank: Tank style water heaters are less expensive than tankless. If you notice your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are running out of hot water very quickly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a water heater inspection.</p>
