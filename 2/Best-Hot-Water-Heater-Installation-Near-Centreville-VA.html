<h2>Water Heater Services Centreville Virginia</h2>
<p>You can't just walk into your local home center and pick the cheapest water heater from the display. Kenmore makes gas and electric water heaters. Residential water heater repair is our most common type of job, so you can rest assured that all our technicians are experts at such repairs. The first kind works similarly to the hot rod in that an electric heating element heats the water. This then makes textiles, cloths, papers, and wood into potential fire hazards if left carelessly near the heating element of the heater.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Replacement Centreville</h3>
<p>Other homeowners will wait until their existing hot water heater completely dies before considering an upgrade to a tankless model. Like any household appliance, water heaters require regular maintenance to operate safely and efficiently.

No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.). Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>
