<h2>Water Heater Services Westmoreland Tennessee</h2>
<p>When it comes to water heaters, there is strong disagreement as to which one type of electric hot water heater is better: whether gas hot water heater or the electric hot water heater. Furthermore, some types of water heater damage cannot be repaired and always require system replacement, regardless of the age of your water heater. Installation for these gas pipes require professionals who know the risks and safety measures needed to ensure that there are no leakages that can cause fires and accidents. This hybrid system makes use of your current plumbing and is a great choice for restaurants or other locations where there is a high demand for hot water.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>Flow rate- Flow rate is how many gallons of hot water a tankless water heater can produce in 1 minute. Tankless water heaters operate by turning on as a hot water tap or appliance is activated, heating the water through a heat exchanger as it is moved to the faucet, dishwasher, washing machine, or shower head. Be sure to look into tankless water heaters because, with this type, you never run out of hot water.</p>

<p>This may be an old resistive type heater and should be replaced by more modern heaters that can be up to 5 times more efficient at heating water. Savings: Unlike traditional water heaters, tankless units only heat water as it is needed, which results in extra energy savings per month. Although gas tankless water heaters are clearly more efficient than their storage tank cousins, their efficiency normally tops out at 80-85%.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we have a choice that will match your needs and conserve energy. Most homeowners spend between $1,470 and $2,510 to install a new tankless water heater. The two main cost factors for installation is the plumber's labor, as well as the heating equipment chosen.

Using the purchase price, annual energy cost, and an estimated cost of installation, we calculated the payback time for both new and replacement installations. A tankless water heater is designed to heat water so incredibly fast that you don't need a storage tank.</p>

<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>
