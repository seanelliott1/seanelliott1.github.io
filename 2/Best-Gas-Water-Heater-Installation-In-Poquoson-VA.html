<h2>Water Heater Services Poquoson Virginia</h2>
<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater repair , maintenance or replacement, you can expect professional service from skilled plumbing experts. It's also advantageous to preemptively upgrade an obsolete water heater to a new model that's more reliable and efficient. Terrano Plumbing and Remodeling proudly endorse Noritz Gas Tankless water heaters as the #1 gas tankless in the industry for residential and commercial applications. Trouble is, most homeowners are unaware of when a water heater reaches its expiration date. Depending on the size of your water heater, this could take a while.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
<p>Tankless usually cost between three and five times as much as a normal water heater for the initial purchase. The problem may be caused by the water heater's main breaker. Endless hot water, additional storage space and lower energy bills are just a few reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. Tankless water heaters also take up much less space and can be installed virtually anywhere in your home.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
<p>Whatever your water heating needs, The Home Depot Canada has everything you need to get the job done right. If the problem persists after a total flush or two, have a pro replace the anode rod in your water heater's tank. One obvious benefit to a tankless water heater is its smaller size.

We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.
