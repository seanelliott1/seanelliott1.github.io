<h2>Water Heater Services Chelsea Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Various devices at home allow us to live and move comfortably. It also means that you should never run out” of hot water, because it is continually heated for as long as you leave hot water running. Electric tankless water heaters are quickly growing in popularity given their potential energy savings and ability to deliver hot water on demand. Interior tankless heaters need to bring in air from the outside, and there are two different methods to accomplish this: power vent and direct vent.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater.

Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>

We provide a range of system types, brands, and sizes, including tank, tankless, hybrid, heat pump, and solar water heaters. With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>
