<h2>Water Heater Services Fullerton California</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>

In addition to tank heaters and tankless systems, there are also multiple fuel sources for your water heater. The solar water heater with a backup water heater will be the cheapest type of heater to use, with annual costs of around $175 for the backup heater operation.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
