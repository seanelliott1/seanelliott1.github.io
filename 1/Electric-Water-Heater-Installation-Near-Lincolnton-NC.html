Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>
<p>With a standard unit you have to keep reheating the water over and over again, day after day, and year after year but a tankless hot water heater gives you an endless supply and uses about 50% less electricity. In regards to the cost of operation, natural gas and propane water heaters are less expensive to operate than electric or oil units of the same size. Traditional water heaters have hot water sitting at the top of the tank ready to go. On a tankless unit, cold water enters the heat exchanger tubing and begins to be heated.</p>
<p>Using a tankless water heater can reduce these costs by up to 50 percent, for an average annual savings of $80. Quite a few water heater manufacturers advise that you flush your water heater at least once a year to decrease the accumulation of minerals. Connect a hose to the water heater's drain valve.

<p>Gas water heater: Connect the gas line to the gas burner control valve. A conventional gas water heater is a tried-and-tested system designed to keep your home's hot water running. You can control the output temperature directly on the tankless water heater, so you know how hot the water is delivered to your taps will be. Tankless heaters have become popular due to their many benefits. They both use an insulated storage tank jacket made of steel, with insulation between the storage tank and the tank jacket to reduce heat loss of the heated water.</p>
<p>It's also possible that some new code requirements have changed since your w. heater was first installed. With a range between $400 and $900, the average homeowner can expect to pay $650 to have a new water heater installed professionally. The right size unit can provide endless hot water for up to two major applications at a time. Standard water heaters can potentially build upscale and rust inside the tank over time, but a tankless unit gives you cleaner and fresh hot water all the time.</p>
