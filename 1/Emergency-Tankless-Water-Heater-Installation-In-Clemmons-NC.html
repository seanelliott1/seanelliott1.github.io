<h2>Water Heater Services Clemmons North Carolina</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning, we are your reliable water heater experts in Merriam. Turn the faucets on at the knobs and allow hot and cold water to flow through the new heater. Four Seasons Plumbing currently offers affordable tankless water heaters and professional service so that we can provide you with the right product for your home. This involves fuel type, tank depth, energy efficiency and which models are right for you.</p>
<p>Apply heat-resistant silicone sealant to the vent shaft of the water heater, slip on a connector and secure with a hose clamp. Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants. Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Installation Clemmons</h3>
<p>These gases are blown through a coil in the base of the water heater, where incoming cold water can absord the heat. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is consistently ready. The life expectancy of a water heater is typically eight to twelve years and, here in our area, it will typically be fueled by gas or electric. Follow these steps to install the new water heater. But there is one possibility of resolving these problems once and for all, and that is a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Low or no hot water: Whether caused by sediment build-up, malfunctioning heating systems, or broken dip tubes, your water heater may fail to produce hot water or the temperature will be lower than normal. If your water heater is not getting power, be sure to turn off the circuit breaker BEFORE checking your electrical connections. A cross connection can occur in a failing shower valve (or any mixing valve) that allows cold water to pass to the hot side, letting cold water into the hot water pipe.</p>
<p>Gallons Per Minute (GPM) represents the amount of hot water a tankless water heater provides per minute. If the extra costs of installing a tankless system are going to outweigh your potential savings, you may want to consider a tank system or a high-efficiency tank system. Gas heaters are touted as being more economical and environmentally friendly than electric, but they also have more components that may wear out or fail.</p>
<p>Service Hero Plumbing is a plumbing referral service provider that works in partnership with established, licensed, & highly rated plumbers based in your local area. This list includes some of the more common problems that people have with tankless hot water heaters, but it is not all inclusive. It could be a lot of money, but it can keep your water heater running for a long time before it needs to be changed.</p>
<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Clemmons NC</h3>
<p>You can even install a tankless unit on your outside wall. Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning at (913) 432-3342 to schedule an appointment. The key feature is that the heater does not turn on until it senses that a hot water tap is being opened. They only heat the water as it's needed, unlike storage tank water heaters that require continuous maintenance of the temperature of the water in the tank.</p>
<p>When the demand for water ceases, the unit shuts down and uses no energy, a revolutionary advantage over a standard water heater. Deciding which water heater offers the best value comes down to a number of factors, such as fuel source, efficiency, water usage, and size. A 100-gallon storage tank is going to take up a lot of room, and buying a water heater that is too large can cause all sorts of problems. The benefit of tankless water heaters in that scenario is that your whole family can take showers back-to-back without worrying about running out of hot water.</p>
<p>If it's time to replace your water heater, you may be thinking of installing a tankless model in your home. If replacing your equipment is the most cost-effective solution, Assured Comfort's technicians will walk you through the types of water heaters that are available, and the features of each so that you can make the selection that's right for your lifestyle and budget. You can rely on our expert plumbers for everything from repairing minor problems to replacing your water heater or helping you find the best type of water heater for your home.</p>

Energy-efficiency: Tankless water heaters reduce your carbon footprint by only using energy when needed to flash heat water.</p>
<p>Compare this to a setup in a home with a small water heater where, potentially, the second or third person wanting to take a shower might have to wait for 20-30 minutes for the water heater to heat enough water. The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
