<h2>Water Heater Services Mercersburg Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The water heater is one of the most important pieces of equipment that anyone has at their home. Since almost all tankless heaters are designed to maintain a desired outlet temperature, they have to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger to do so. This means that there is a limit to how much hot water they can provide at a given temperature rise or "Delta T". Basically, if you try to use more hot water at one time than the heater can provide it will limit the output volume to maintain the desired temperature.</p>
<p>Rather than installing it in your utility room or basement, they are small enough to be installed in non-traditional spaces such as closets. Imagine this situation: Your hot water heater bursts. Whether you know exactly what type of water heater you want or you have questions about which one is right for you we are standing by. Call us today and we can help you decide which water heater is the best one for your current usage & situation.</p>
