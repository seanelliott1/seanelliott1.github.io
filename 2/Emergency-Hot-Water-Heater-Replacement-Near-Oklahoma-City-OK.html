<h2>Water Heater Services Oklahoma City Oklahoma</h2>
<p>When it's time to replace your old water heater, you'll want it done fast and at a fair price. Gas hot water heater installation (hot water heater system replacement) is NOT a DIY (do-it-yourself) project. There is no need to wait until your hot water heater breaks down or becomes inefficient.

<p>Low or no hot water: Whether caused by sediment build-up, malfunctioning heating systems, or broken dip tubes, your water heater may fail to produce hot water or the temperature will be lower than normal. If your water heater is not getting power, be sure to turn off the circuit breaker BEFORE checking your electrical connections. A cross connection can occur in a failing shower valve (or any mixing valve) that allows cold water to pass to the hot side, letting cold water into the hot water pipe.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
