<h2>Water Heater Services Oak Brook Illinois</h2>
<p>All homes need to have hot water, and your water heater is what makes it happen. Don't wake up every day to a long wait for hot water—or worse, an icy cold shower. If you have an electric water heater, this will mean being wired into the home's electrical grid. Get valuable information if you are considering replacing your existing water heater with a new tankless water heater. If your water heater is older and you need frequent repairs to keep it running smoothly, a new unit is likely a good idea.</p>
<p>Gas hot water system installation cost is typically between $250 and $700 to replace an old hot water system with the same type in the same spot. With a tankless water heater, there is no tank to heat up, so the supply of hot water is endless. Enjoy reliable hot water with expert water heater repair and installation services from Marc Francis Plumbing, your plumbing pros in the Tri-Cities. Before looking for Cumming water heater repair services, it can be useful to have a general idea of what might be the underlying problem so you know what to expect.</p>

A tankless gas water heater lasts around 20 years, while a traditional gas water heater lasts about 15. New systems are often more reliable as well, so you won't have to worry about running out of hot water at inconvenient times.</p>

<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>Electric water heater: Connect the circuit wires to the water heater leads in the electrical junction box on the heater unit. A propane appliance like a hot water tank is a little less forgiving of problems than some of the larger built-in units you would find in most homes, so ensuring it is properly cleaned and maintained will help it last longer as well as keep you safer. In many cases it is a simple fix and does not require a new hot water heater.</p>

Navien's Condensing Tankless Water Heaters can provide an endless supply of hot water on demand because our units activate the second you open the hot water tap. Improperly installed gas lines can leak, creating an explosion risk. Make sure the power is connected to the heater, then reset the thermostat.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are popular in Europe and other countries around the world, although they were not introduced in the United States until 1979. No longer will you have to wait for hot water, wasting gallons at a time. If you combine that with a regular maintenance routine you can add years to your water heater's service life. List the phone numbers to preferred local handyman services, water damage restoration companies, pest control companies, electricians, roofing companies, plumbers, carpet cleaners, home improvement contractors, and so on.

Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
