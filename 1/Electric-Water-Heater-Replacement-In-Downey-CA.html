Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>Portable water heaters are good choices for adding hot water to out buildings, shops or garages. Turn on a faucet in a nearby room to hot and listen for the heater to turn on. Then, look at every joint on the heater to make sure there is no leakages. However, the process is very easy with a tankless gas water heater. Whether you use a traditional or a tankless water heater, you need to keep an eye out for mineral buildup inside your water heater.</p>
<p>Households that use more hot water, in any climate, may also find that when they ask are tankless water heaters worth it the answer is yes and no. This is because they will be using so much hot water that their heater is working just as much whether it is a tankless or a conventional. We'll answer all these questions so that you can have your hot water restored in no time. Changing from electric to gas or visa-versa could incur additional costs in venting, plumbing changes and even electrical.</p>
