<p>With all of the different problems that can result from having a hot water heater, it's always good to know what the most common ones are and how to handle them. If your demand is higher, then a whole house” tankless water heater or two or more tankless systems will be able to keep up with the demand of your household. When you choose to retrofit a tankless water heater in place of a storage tank variety, your plumber-installer will take more time, increasing the installed cost, of replacing a storage tank water heater because of the complexity of relocating existing piping.</p>
<p>One of the things to consider when planning a water heater installation project is the installation cost. Press the black probe firmly against the metal tank or the heating element mounting nuts or screws (not the other terminal screw). There are some elements that set each type of water heater a apart from one another. If your old water heater used copper piping, you may choose to plumb it with copper piping again.</p>
