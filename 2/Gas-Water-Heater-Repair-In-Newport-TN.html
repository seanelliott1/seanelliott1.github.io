<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Newport</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>Outside of the GPM produced by most tankless heaters, there are a few heaters that go beyond the average, heating 7.5-11 GPM. Tankless water heaters feature an adjustable thermostat control. Don't pay to heat a tank full of water while away or worry about a tank water heater springing a leak. To install this, you will need some tape measure, a spirit level, a square edge, a pencil, an electric drill, a drill bit and a fixing kit suitable for the wall, a T&P valve and drain, a wrench, a hammer, oakum, jointing compound.</p>
