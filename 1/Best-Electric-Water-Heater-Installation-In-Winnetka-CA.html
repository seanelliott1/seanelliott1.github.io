They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater.</p>
<p>A lot goes into installation, including safety, plumbing permits from the county, and gas, electrical, or other connections. For starters, with an electric hot water heater you you can kill the gas line coming into the house, if you already have one or completely eliminate the need to put one in, if you do. This will leave you with one less bill to worry about. As these heating systems are tankless, your risk of flooding is diminished.</p>
<p>In part that's because removing a large tank takes more time and effort than removing the much smaller tankless units.

<p>Because water heaters are in constant contact with water, it's common for them to deteriorate over time. The overall cost of owning a water heater will depend on a number of factors such as the number of people using the heater, operating expenses, and remodeling done in the home. Nothing lasts forever, least of all a water heater. The calcified minerals clog the drain valve, slow the heating process, overheating the bottom of your tank and affecting the metal integrity of your tank's walls to the point where leaks can and do occur.</p>
