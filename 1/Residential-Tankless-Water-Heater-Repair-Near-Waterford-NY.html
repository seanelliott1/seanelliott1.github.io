<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Replacement Waterford</h3>
<p>In the event that this valve does not work then you know you will have to start looking for a replacement. Some residential water heaters seem to have been placed by chance rather function. Before you decide to purchase a new water heater, you may want to determine if it can, in fact, be repaired. Tankless water heaters can be sized to provide a continuous flow of hot water, making them suitable for large families that use a lot of hot water at one time.</p>
<p>Tankless electric units have shorter life spans, on the order of 7 to 10 years. Your vent is undersized at 3”. This application requires a short water heater, a minimum of a 12” connector rise, 4” vent, and a new gas cock. Instead, why not turn to the new technology that has been around for 50 years - tankless water heaters. For larger households that use more than 86 gallons of hot water each day, tankless systems can be up to 14% more energy efficient than traditional water heaters.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>The cost of hot water can be a determining factor when considering water heater repair versus water heater replacement.

Even if you are replacing your water heater with a conventional one, the installation process is not as simple as it might seem.</p>
<p>TIP: Turn your water heater off two hours in advance to allow the water to cool. Gauging an everyday tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater.
