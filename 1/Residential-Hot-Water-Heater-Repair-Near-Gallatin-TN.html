We will show you the potential causes and after you enter your model number into the search field, we'll sell you the exact part that fits your water heater and show you how to install it. Light the pilot light in the new water heater and adjust the temperature setting. The water that flows through the pipes isn't halted at any point to be heated so you may have to set the thermostat a bit higher to get the temperature of water you want for your shower, bath or dishwasher.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it.
