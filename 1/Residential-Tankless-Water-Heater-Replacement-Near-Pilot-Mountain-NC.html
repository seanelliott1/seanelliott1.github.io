<h2>Water Heater Services Pilot Mountain North Carolina</h2>
<p>A tankless gas hot water heater can be complicated when it comes to piping and venting requirements. In addition, many state and local utilities offer rebates and incentives for converting to energy-saving appliances, which can help mitigate the cost of installing a tankless system. The payoff is big — you'll save up to 60% of the water heater part of your electric bill. If your water heater needs to be repaired periodically, then a decision to replace it needs to be taken. When the water on the top of the tank is hot, the top element turns off and the lower one heats.</p>
<p>In third place is the gas-powered tankless water heater. Water, not warming enough is one of the most straightforward sign you will receive from your instant water heater if something is wrong. And electric tankless models draw so much power—120 to 160 amps—that you may have to upgrade the electrical service to your house to 200 amps or more. In most cases, a person is going to notice that there are small signs that the water heater is getting ready to fail before it completely quits.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are popular options for water heater replacements, and they're only going to become more popular as homeowners discover their numerous advantages. It could be as simple as adjusting the heat so the water gets hotter. When we manage an installation, we actually take the time to remove and drain your old unit before hauling it away. Tankless water heaters are usually powered with electricity or gas.</p>

<p>Here at Beehive Plumbing we have experience with all types of gas water heaters. Tankless units can only supply a few gallons of hot water at a time. Talk to your plumbing service technician about the cost of the required repairs to restore your water heater's function versus the cost of purchasing and installing a new system. Because the anode rod wears away over time, it's important to inspect and replace it as needed in order to maintain your water heater.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>

No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.).
