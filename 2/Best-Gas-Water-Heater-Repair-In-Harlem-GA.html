<h2>Water Heater Services Harlem Georgia</h2>
<p>When it comes to a clean burning fuel source to supply your hot water requirements as well as a quick recovery time, a natural gas water heater can certainly take care of your needs. Their line of AquaStar tankless water heaters continue to set the standard with an efficiency range of 80% - 87%. So long as all is well, you should have hot water in no time. One drawback to electric units is its limited output, which tops out at 36 kilowatts, or about 123,000 Btus. When you're interested in installing a tankless water heater, we come to your home, inspect your plumbing system, and lay out a road map for exactly how your installation will work.</p>
<p>If you notice that your tankless water heater is making an unusual noise, that your energy bills are higher than normal, or that your water is not as hot as it should be, give our plumbers a call. A tank-style water heater expends energy around the clock to maintain the temperature of a 40 to 50-gallon water supply so that hot water is ready when it's needed. Tankless water heating systems are a smart and effective way of heating your water.</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater. Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car. For our California customers we will also properly earthquake strap and brace the water heater as required by the California state code for earthquake safety.</p>

<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>
<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Harlem GA</h3>
<p>Fischer Plumbing can assist with all of your tankless hot water heater needs. Traditional tank water heaters store the water in a tank or boiler until it is needed. The good news is that electric water heaters don't need venting. While many water heaters have a long service life in your home, these important pieces of equipment do not last forever. This way you will cut the installation costs. When the hot water tap is turned off, the water heater turns off.</p>
<p>If so, a tankless water heater may be a good option for your home and your family. A tankless system on the other hand doesn't store water, but rather heats it only when you need it. It does this through a design of super-heated coils. If your water heater is leaking or isn't heating your water well enough, call today. Draining the water heater is easy but be sure to get it started first since it will take a while to drain off and no one wants to carry water heater up a flight of stairs while there's still water in it. It makes it heavy and will more than likely create a mess along the way.</p>

Tank water heaters are the most common type of water heater. Therefore, they avoid the standby heat losses associated with storage water heaters. A water heater is a complex machine and one that is placed under a lot of stress during operation.</p>

As long as these needs are met, it is convenient for tankless water heating to take place in the bathroom. These water heaters operate in tandem with your home heating system and are often seen in conjunction with boilers. There are ways to prevent sediment buildup, including regular maintenance, using a water softener to reduce the number of contaminants in your water, and keeping your overall water heater temperature at or below 130 degrees.</p>
<p>Although it's a relatively simple process, it takes a professional plumber to install a tankless water heater. Gas type heaters also need proper ventilation, so remember that before you decide to purchase a unit. That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. If your area has hard water or your heater is set to run at a high temperature, it may need maintenance twice a year.</p>
