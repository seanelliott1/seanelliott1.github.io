<h2>Water Heater Services Maryville Missouri</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Here at Althoff, we have professional plumbers that can install any size water heater for residential and commercial buildings, and they have the knowledge, experience and skill to pull the required permits and properly install the water heater. If you are finding that your water is not getting hot enough or that it is running out quickly, it could be time for a new heating element for your water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are popular options for water heater replacements, and they're only going to become more popular as homeowners discover their numerous advantages. It could be as simple as adjusting the heat so the water gets hotter. When we manage an installation, we actually take the time to remove and drain your old unit before hauling it away. Tankless water heaters are usually powered with electricity or gas.</p>

<p>Petri Plumbing & Heating, Inc. Tankless water heaters heat only the water you use, rather than heating and storing water continuously.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Maryville MO</h3>
<p>For homes that use 41 gallons of water or less, tankless water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient. The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot. Most property owners don't think about replacing water heaters until it's a need. For example, many homes, regardless of the type of fuel source used to heat hot water tanks now require a 4” exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>Thanks to the low emission of potentially health-threatening elements tankless water heaters are environment-friendly. If your current hot water heater cannot meet your needs, new water heater installation is likely the best choice. Higher installation cost - You might run into a higher installation cost because of venting requirements, as well as the placement of additional tankless units around the home. If your existing hot water heater is good, just requiring maintenance, minor repairs, or new fittings, we can get you working again in no time.</p>

Overall, tankless water heaters are about 85% efficient compared to conventional hot water tanks, which are about 60% efficient. Tank-type water heaters not only heat water but also store it in a tank until it's ready for use.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters never run out of hot water, putting an end to organizing cooking, laundry, and showering around how much hot water is in the tank. Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
