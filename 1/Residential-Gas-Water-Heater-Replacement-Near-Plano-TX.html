For a tankless water heater that makes 40 gallons or less of hot water every day, owners enjoy about 34% more energy efficiency over traditional heaters For those who utilize a lot of hot water (more than 80 gallons) every day, this efficiency is around 14 percent.</p>
<p>Gas water heaters are a little different from other types of water heaters, so it is important that the technician working on the heater has the right tools and experience. Water pooling around or under your water heater is a sign of either corrosion or a damaged part. Tankless water heaters are a cost effective option for residential or commercial water heaters. Everyday tank water heaters retain large capacities of water, commonly around 50 gallons at a time.</p>

Energy Efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water, using about 35% less energy than a tank water heater. While it's true that the T&P Valve is likely to leak after testing it, the danger involved if it failed makes the risk of a leak worth it.
