<p>Regardless of whether you live in a rented apartment or your own home, hot water heater technology plays a very important role in your everyday life. In the instance that there is not enough hot water and you have ensured that the tank is not leaking, you can flush the tank so that mineral deposits are not reducing its efficiency. If your water heater is exhibiting any of the above signs or if it has stopped working all together, it's time to call in your local professionals. Gas heaters are also historically less expensive than electric heaters to run. When repair costs begin to outweigh the benefit it's time to replace your tankless water heater.</p>
