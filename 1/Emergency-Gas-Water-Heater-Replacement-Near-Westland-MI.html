<h2>Water Heater Services Westland Michigan</h2>
<p>All households require hot water, so your water heater is one of your most essential home appliances. As the name suggests, this type of water heater does not have a storage tank. Regularly scheduled maintenance can help extend the life of the water heater and it includes performing a water heater flush, checking the valves and connections for leaks and more. If you are not looking to apply more then one outlet then you would be well served by the standard and far less expensive model of the tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Been a back to back winner of BEE Energy Award and MNRE Awards, Racold has reached the epitome of innovation with its solar, electric and gas based water heaters. While far from difficult, installing an electric water heater does involve plumbing and electrical work, which may be enough to put off quite a few people. Units that support recirculation deliver instant hot water more efficiently. When you notice a noise, shut the water heater and call for professional help.</p>
<p>If LPG gas installation is required, including gas bottle installation, LPG installation cost would be in the $250 to $500 range, depending on the lengths of the pipe runs. The energy efficiency of the boiler or hot water tank storage system comes from the dual use, which reduces standing water heat loss and offsets electric energy use with natural gas. We perform all the water heater services you need, from installing a high-efficiency unit to keeping the appliance up and running for years to come.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Installation Westland</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>There are times when constant water heater repair in Thousand Oaks isn't in your best interest. The tankless water heater will give the household a luxury of hot water on demand at the press of a button. We'll also make sure that you have a system where a tankless water heater installation can happen or that you understand the modifications that need to be made before we can complete that. The first reason is that they are looking for a water heater that is able to offer them better energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Tank-type water heaters store hot water so that it's available when needed. Whether you'd like an electric water heater, gas water heater, or an energy-efficient tankless water heater, our skilled plumbers can help with the selection and installation. Switch off the gas valve and turn off the electric supply to the heater at the circuit breaker — watch the pilot light go out to ensure no more gas remains.</p>
<p>As with any home repair project, water heater replacement is largely dependent on the individual characteristics of the home in which it is being installed. Contact Parkway Mechanical online or call 219-942-6626 to schedule your tankless water heater installation.

Replaced 38 gallon lowboy short electric water heater and thermal expansion tank.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are installed near the point of use, or place where the hot water is needed. A tank style heater stores a specific amount of water, keeping it heated at the temperature you choose, sending it along when you turn on the hot water faucet. If you have a gas power heater, you have to install it about eighteen inches off the ground. When considering a tankless water heating system, one major thing to look into is the kind of fuel you want to use for heating.</p>

They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when used in homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water each day, according to They also last about double the amount of time as long as a tank water heater. Space Savers: Tankless water heater installation is more convenient because these small systems can easily be installed under a sink or in a cabinet - taking a fraction of the space of your traditional system.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>

If you have a smaller family, or you're just a couple without kids then we have a unit for you as well in a smaller capacity energy-efficient unit that will keep the hot water coming.</p>
<p>If your tank is leaking or the water is no longer running clear, these are cases where you absolutely have to replace your heater altogether. Copy the nameplate data of the water heater to purchase correct replacement parts. As water heaters generally hold 50 gallons of water, a breakdown can result in a damaging flood. If repair is not an option, we will help you determine the best replacement. One set of coils is the water line, the other, the heating element.</p>
<p>Use channel-type pliers or a pipe wrench to loosen and disconnect the lines from the water heater. Over time, water heaters often suffer from sediment build-up that can damage the tank. For example, a sudden loss of hot water may mean that the pilot has gone out. Be sure to connect the cold water pipe to the cold water inlet on the water heater. Cold water enters the tank and is heated by an electric element or gas burner.</p>
