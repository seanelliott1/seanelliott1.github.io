<p>A tankless gas hot water heater can be complicated when it comes to piping and venting requirements. In addition, many state and local utilities offer rebates and incentives for converting to energy-saving appliances, which can help mitigate the cost of installing a tankless system. The payoff is big — you'll save up to 60% of the water heater part of your electric bill. If your water heater needs to be repaired periodically, then a decision to replace it needs to be taken.
