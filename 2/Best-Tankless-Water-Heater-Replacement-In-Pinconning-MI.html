We provide everything from hot water tank replacement to water heater maintenance. I called and the very next day they came out and repaired my heating service and did an excellent job. As mentioned, installing a new water heater of any type requires expertise in electrical, gas, and plumbing. Colder incoming groundwater temperature will limit the product options to the higher kW units, which require a larger electrical service and breaker size capacity.</p>
<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode. Tankless water heaters are not measured on the capacity of water they hold but on how many gallons of hot water they can produce per minute. There are three main reasons why your electric heater might not be producing hot water.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Pinconning</h3>
<p>The optimal size of a water heater is based on the number of occupants in the house and the peak water demand. This means that tankless water heaters don't produce the same standby energy losses that traditional units do while they keep standing water warm and ready for use, which can save you hundreds of dollars on your energy bills. Rarely, both elements will test OK, but you're still not getting hot water.</p>
<p>If there's too much scale buildup in the pipes, or faucet and showerhead aerators are clogged, or a turned-down faucet reduces water flow to about 0.3 gpm, these units automatically shut off.

<p>The type of tankless water heater chosen for any given application will depend on incoming water temperatures and building use patterns. And if you need your existing system serviced or repaired, our professional, factory-trained technicians will identify the issues and make repairs. With a typical shower flow-rate of 2.5 to 3 gallons per minute (or slightly less with modern fixtures and flow restrictors), most tankless heaters will not be able to keep up with a secondary demand, for instance, from a dishwasher, clothes washer, or second shower location.</p>
