<h2>Water Heater Services Aston Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>A hot water heater problem poses a lot of stress to households in cold areas. Replacing the dip tube also requires removing the cold water pipe, and changing out the heating element requires dealing with 220 volt electricity, so if you're not experienced with plumbing and electrical work, it may be best to leave these jobs to your local master plumber In addition, any repair work needed for gas heaters is best left to a skilled technician in order to avoid the risk of fire, gas leaks, or personal injury.</p>
<p>Your water heater is your last defense for dealing with freezing cold water, which is why you should always stay on top of regular maintenance and care. Whether it's powered by electricity or natural gas, your water heater isn't built to last forever. Once the system is all hooked up and properly tested, you're ready to start using your new water heating system. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Direct vent heaters are slightly higher in efficiency over standard water heaters but are significantly less efficient than tankless water heaters. The statistical life expectancy of a storage tank water heater is 10-12 years, depending on care and maintenance. For those suffering from a leaky water heater, John Moore can even repair your water damaged walls and floors without the headache of dealing with multiple contractors.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Aston</h3>
<p>When shopping for your next water heater, your fuel source will be the first variable to consider when sorting through options. Many times, the handyman of the family will see a new hot water heater or a tankless hot water heater in the household supply stores. A huge puddle of water all over your basement floor and it is coming from the bottom of the water heater. Keep the drain valve in the front as best as you can to easily drain out water later on in the water heater's life.</p>
<p>One of the best advantages of an instant heating system is that you can heat up the amount of water you need and only when you need it. There is less energy wastage compared to heating a full tank of water, and reheating it again after it has cooled down. Switching to tankless from a storage tank water heater is no easy swap because it requires a plumbing retrofit and possibly an upgrade to your electric service or gas lines to increase capacity.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>4. Replacing with a tankless water heater doesn't require a permit or inspection. A point-of-use unit provides hot water for a single fixture. When demand is high, a traditional tank heater can run out, leaving you (or a family member or guests) in the cold. Our water heater installation experts will discuss all of the different options available to you, discuss the benefits of gas water heaters versus electric water heaters, and help you make the most energy and cost efficient solution for your home.</p>

Clean the gas burner and replace the thermocoupler (a safety device that shuts off the gas automatically if the pilot flame goes out).</p>
<p>When you turn on a hot water tap in your home, either a gas burner or an electric element directly heats the cold water that travels through a pipe into the unit.

VENTING: Noncondensing tankless gas heaters use stainless-steel vents that can withstand high exhaust heat. Here are a few hot water tank brands we carry and install on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time. The only way to know if your current hot w. heater is collecting minerals and deposits is to call a qualified plumber and have them come out and inspect your w. heater.</p>

<p>Like their name implies, these compact units heat your water without the use of a cumbersome tank that takes up space in your utility room or basement. Although uncommon, issues can arise if something isn't working correctly within your water heater. Iinstead of waiting until your heater breaks, you should plan (now, while the water is hot!) for your water heater's replacement. Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households.</p>
<p>Water Heaters Only, Inc provides water heater service in San Jose and the surrounding and the surrounding communities including: Santa Clara, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Morgan Hill and Monte Serreno. Tankless water heaters can be powered by both gas and electricity. If you have a gas water heater, turn off the gas shutoff valve in the supply line, too, before disconnecting it. If your gas water heater has a fan unit, unplug it. If your water heater's electric, unplug it. If there's a cable connection, switch off the power first, then disconnect the cable.</p>
<p>Gas models can deliver up to 96% thermal efficiency and generate a constant flow of 4 gallons per minute, resulting in continuous hot water for your home. However, a broken thermostat can also tip the water temperature in the opposite direction and can mean that your hot water gets way too hot. If you hear odd sounds when you use your shower, you should contact your water heater repair contractor because something is seriously wrong with the heater.</p>
<p>A tankless heater can reduce the wait time” for hot water for your shower or any other use. Safety - With tankless water heaters there is virtually no chance of your child or anyone else being scalded by hot water out of the tap. There are some common mistakes that homeowners make with their water heaters that should be avoided. If the tankless water heater doesn't properly vent out exhaust gases from the heat exchanger, it can cause the heat exchanger to corrode, and this can be potentially harmful to your house.</p>
<p>This saves you more on energy costs. Energy efficiency was Excellent and annual operating costs were low, just $240. Tankless water heaters also typically have a longer warranty. Prior to buying the hot & electric heaters you can even go through the online reviews. Something else to think about is if you can't upgrade to a larger conventional water heater because it may not fit. If you have limited space in your utility room or you like saving money on the energy bill and having consistent hot water, you need a tankless water heater installation estimate from AC Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning.</p>
