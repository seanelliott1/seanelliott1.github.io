<h2>Water Heater Services Du Bois Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we imagine doing things very easy. The most important component in the tankless water heater is the heat exchanger; this component requires periodic flushing. If we believe that we can repair your hot water heater, we'll complete repairs on the spot. Whether you live in a historic house with vintage pipes or a brand new home with state-of-the-art systems, Lakewood Plumbing & Heating can handle any plumbing challenge.

<p>Free in-home estimates to replace your water heater. Before you purchase a water heater, it's also a good idea to estimate its annual operating costs and compare those costs with other less or more energy-efficient models. At a $180 yearly cost reduction, it will take 3.5 to 8 years to recover the additional expense and begin to save money. The fact that it costs significantly more to purchase and install is the only danger preventing everyone from enjoying the energy efficiency of a tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>Apply heat-resistant silicone sealant to the vent shaft of the water heater, slip on a connector and secure with a hose clamp. Circuit wiring is usually housed in flexible metal cable or conduit where it connects to the water heater. So if the tank you use is well insulated and the boiler you use is highly efficient, this can be the least expensive way to provide hot water for a home's occupants. Using a natural gas rate of $10.86 per 1,000 cubic feet, we calculated that the payback time for converting from a storage tank gas water heater to a gas tankless ranges from 22½ years to 27½ years.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes.

<p>A recirculating pump will push the cold water in your pipes back to the water heater, saving water and making sure you have hot water as soon as you turn on the tap. These heaters are versatile enough to be used for a variety of purposes including bathrooms and hot tubs, for appliances like dishwashers and washing machines, and as a booster for solar water heaters. If your current system is outdated, there will be other costs such as replacing the ductwork or plumbing.</p>
<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, your water heater system likely requires repair or replacement. As mentioned above, tankless water heaters are smaller than traditional tank heaters. If your water heater isn't heating up or is leaking, you might be able to repair it instead of having it replaced. The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
