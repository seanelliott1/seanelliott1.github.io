A final thing to consider is the expected time to replacement for the hot water heater. In an instant water heater system, the water is already heated to the set temperature as it travels through the pipes. They heat water directly, delivering a continuous flow so you never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>

Likewise, if the existing wiring in your home cannot adequately supply electricity to your tankless water heater, there is a small chance that the wiring could short, which could potentially start an electric fire.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters never run out of hot water, putting an end to organizing cooking, laundry, and showering around how much hot water is in the tank. Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
