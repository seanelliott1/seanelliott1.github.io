<h2>Water Heater Services Ripon Wisconsin</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket.

One of the best plumbing appliances that we have in our homes and businesses is the water heater. VENTING: Noncondensing tankless gas heaters use stainless-steel vents that can withstand high exhaust heat. Here are a few hot water tank brands we carry and install on a regular basis.</p>
