<h2>Water Heater Services Canby Oregon</h2>
<p>How often did you take a shower and the water started to run cold before you were finished? Rather than fill up a tank full of water and then heat it, the the electric tankless heater senses water flowing through it, activates the electric heating circuit, and the water is heated instantly. Because we wanted to be able to easily move the tank for servicing or repair we decided to put a union fitting on both the cold and hot lines as they left the tank. The claims range from "endless hot water" to huge savings on home energy bills.</p>
<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>The small device can be installed underneath a sink on the wall where hot and cold water supply lines are accessible. Another one of the advantages that comes along with using a tankless water heater is that it lasts a lot longer than your standard water heater. It is best to have a professional take care of these type of issues as there are electrical and water hazards involved in making these repairs. Having tankless heater in your house produces endless supply of hot water.</p>
