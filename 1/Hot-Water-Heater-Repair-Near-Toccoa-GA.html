<h2>Water Heater Services Toccoa Georgia</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode. Tankless water heaters are not measured on the capacity of water they hold but on how many gallons of hot water they can produce per minute. There are three main reasons why your electric heater might not be producing hot water. There are different brand names of tankless water heaters to choose from since this kind of home appliances is in demand in the market with different designs, sizes and features.</p>
<p>Heat pump water heaters qualify as tank-type water heaters and are powered by electricity. You turn on the shower and feel warm water at first, but then get blasted with several seconds of cold water before the temperature slowly climbs back up. Here's what happened: When the first shower ended, some hot water was remaining in the pipes on the way to the shower. Call your local water heating experts at B&B Heating & Cooling.</p>

<p>There are some common problems that can happen with the water heater, such as, discolored water, foul-smelling water, leaking tank or odd noises coming from the tank. We'll complete your replacement quickly and efficiently, hauling away your old water heater and disposing of it at the proper facility. It is inserted into the cold water inlet side of the heater with the flared end at the top of the heater.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>A Leaky Tank: If you notice that your water heater is leaking, you could be experiencing loose pipes or a failed valve. The idea is to embark on a proactive search for the plumbing services before your water heater breaks down. But as time passes by and your water heater is slowly decaying, you can expect its relief valve to lose its function. Because tankless water heaters don't store heated water, they use less energy and save you money on your utility bills.</p>
<p>The average cost for a plumber to install a water heater is about $80 per hour. If the sacrificial anode rod is not replaced once it has been fully corroded, your hot water storage tank will begin to corrode, meaning you will probably have to replace it prematurely. One or both heating elements may have burned out and need replacing. When purchased from a Rinnai® authorized dealer and installed by a licensed installation professional, your Rinnai® tankless water heater comes with a generous warranty to give you even more peace of mind.</p>

<p>This is especially true for those units that have gone without proper maintenance or repairs when needed. That's 2X the life of a traditional hot water heater. When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source. Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Compare this to a traditional water heater tank, which usually only gets 7-10 years of life before it needs to be replaced. Many utility companies offer rebates on certain models of water heaters, generally those certified as low energy utilizing models. Tankless water heaters that use natural gas are about 23 percent more efficient than a traditional storage version, which is about 60 percent efficient, according to the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Incorrect Size: When you first bought your water heater, it could've been the perfect size for your needs-things change as well as water needs, so you may want a new water heater to meet those specific needs. Once it has been determined that a tankless heater will benefit you, our professionally trained technicians will assess your ground water temperature and determine the flow of water through your home or business to help determine which model will be the best fit for your needs.</p>

<p>2. You can decide to replace it when you get discolored or tainted water when you turn on the hot tap. For homes with high daily water demands, multiple tankless heaters can be installed. Also, since tank-style heaters have been around longer and are more common, more professionals are capable of installing them and the labor costs are lower. If you think you might have a shower, washing machine, and kitchen sink going at the same time, you'll need a unit that can supply 6 GPM (2.5 + 2.0 + 1.5 = 6.0 GPM).</p>
<p>When you need a new tankless water heater installed, your first task should be to select a reliable plumbing company who will provide you with free written price quotes, a history of reliability and integrity, a connection to your community, and a dedication to customer service and satisfaction. The peak hour demand or first-hour rating (FHR) is the measure of how much hot water the heater will deliver in an hour, and the FHR is required by law to appear on the Energy Guide label.</p>

In addition to providing you with a wide selection of tankless water heaters at your local Ferguson, you can also buy tankless water heaters online. The distance from the water heater to the faucet will determine the time it takes for hot water to reach the faucet. Tankless units let you regain space in your home because they're mounted on the wall instead of installing in corners, closets, basements and utility rooms.</p>
