<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>

Along with our furnaces and boilers, our water heaters are also available in various styles, efficiency levels, and brands - one of which includes the Navien brand.</p>

Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install.
