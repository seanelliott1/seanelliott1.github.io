<p>Below are some good reasons why you should consider a tankless hot water heater for your new or pre-existing home, office, workshop, or cabin project. There are other advantages to having a tankless water heater and that you will not have to worry about your young ones going down and playing with the facet that is on the outside of the water heater and taking a chance on getting burnt in the end with it.

<h3>Affordable Hot Water Heater Repair Jarrettsville</h3>
<p>Also consider the hot water heater installation cost or water heater replacement cost. Additionally, if you have a gas system, you will need to modify the gas lines feeding the heater and this can be very costly.

A tank-less water heater has lower operating costs, uses less space and can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30%.</p>
<p>They can cut your water heating bills in half and earn you a nice utility rebate from Duke Energy. Most homes have a storage tank for hot water — 50 gallons or more that's regularly reheated and ready to use 24 hours a day. Because they use up to 30 to 50 percent less energy, tankless units can save an average family about $100 or more annually, depending on water usage. Regular maintenance is required for a longer life of a water heater.</p>
<p>If you have a water heater with a re-circulation pump, we can check that the pump is working correctly and re-install the existing pump or replace the re-circulation pump if needed during your water heater replacement.

<p>Our team will provide exceptional water heater repairs when you need them, any time of the day or night. Their higher efficiency comes from not having to use any energy keeping a tank full of stored water hot. The temperature and pressure valve is one of the most important safety features installed on a heater. The water inside this tank is heated up and then released into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank.</p>
