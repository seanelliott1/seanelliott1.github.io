<h2>Water Heater Services Deatsville Alabama</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>This is because the flow of energy is easier to regulate with an electric connection, plus the pilot light has to be properly ignited with a gas connection. And no tanks means no hot water sitting unused, reducing your overall heating costs by hundreds of dollars. If it's too big, you may be spending more money than necessary to heat up the water within the tank. We keep water heaters stocked at TLC so we can replace your water heater day or night.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing.
