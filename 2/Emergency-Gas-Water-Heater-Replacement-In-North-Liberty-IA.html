In this tank, cold water is used to fill the tank, and an element, usually near the top & bottom inside the tank is used to heat it. In between the inside tank and the outer shell is often insulation to help keep the water hot, without the elements having to do all of the work.

With a typical shower flow-rate of 2.5 to 3 gallons per minute (or slightly less with modern fixtures and flow restrictors), most tankless heaters will not be able to keep up with a secondary demand, for instance, from a dishwasher, clothes washer, or second shower location.</p>
