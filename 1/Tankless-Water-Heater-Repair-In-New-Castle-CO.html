<h2>Water Heater Services New Castle Colorado</h2>
<p>It's hard to believe it, but over 19,000 water heaters are replaced every day. Most conventional natural-draft water heaters vent exhaust completely different than any tankless water heater, and though they are a fuel burning appliance, they do need power to operate. Many thermostats have a reset button which can sometimes be pushed to reset the circuit and get the water heater working again. Once we've discussed your viable options and you've made a selection, our technicians can carefully remove your old water heater and safely install your new one.</p>
<p>If a water heater is installed without a T&P valve (temperature and pressure relief valve) it may explode. Tankless water heaters are not measured on the capacity of water they hold but on how many gallons of hot water they can produce per minute. There are three main reasons why your electric heater might not be producing hot water. There are different brand names of tankless water heaters to choose from since this kind of home appliances is in demand in the market with different designs, sizes and features.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the type of traditional hot water tank you had, you may be able to install it in the same area.

Our 24-hour emergency plumbers offer a complete range of solutions that can get a faulty system back up and running in no time. Many homeowners are interested in how tankless water heaters can save them money, since these units are more energy efficient than their tank counterparts.</p>

You don't have to worry about a water heater that is constantly heating up water, because the tankless water heater will only heat up the water that you need since it provides on-demand hot water. Although tankless water heaters are also called "instantaneous water heaters," they still take time to heat water, so after the trapped water was used up, you were left with a gap of unheated water.</p>
<p>Compare this to a traditional water heater tank, which usually only gets 7-10 years of life before it needs to be replaced. Many utility companies offer rebates on certain models of water heaters, generally those certified as low energy utilizing models. Tankless water heaters that use natural gas are about 23 percent more efficient than a traditional storage version, which is about 60 percent efficient, according to the Department of Energy.</p>
