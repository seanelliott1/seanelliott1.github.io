Drain out a gallon of water from the water heater, so it's not completely full at the plumbing connections on top.

<p>Tankless water heaters never run out of hot water, putting an end to organizing cooking, laundry, and showering around how much hot water is in the tank. Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
