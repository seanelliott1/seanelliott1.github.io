When we install a new water heater, our water heater experts will ensure that any gas and electrical connections are handled safely, and the water heater is installed properly. Endless hot water and lower energy bills are two reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. You can enjoy consistent hot water by scheduling professional service when it's needed.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters (such as demand-type water heaters and tankless coil water heaters) prevent standby heat losses. When you multiply that usage by each household member, the demands placed on the water heater is brought into perspective. Small families and studio apartments can often use a 20 gallon electric or tankless water heater (if the apartments are on individual units). When it comes to water heaters, repair isn't always the most cost-effective option.</p>

<p>If you're using a gas-powered water heater, the burner assembly must be connected to the gas line. This is because the heating coils are in the pipes and ready to heat the water as soon as it is needed.

<p>A tankless water heater warms up water as it passes through, eliminating the need for a bulky water storage container. Tank-type water heaters consume energy on an ongoing basis to keep water hot in a tank. Sizing a regular tank water heater can be quicker than a tankless water heater. Logic suggests that if you pay to heat water only at those peak times, it must cost less than heating water all the time.

<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>

If your gas water heater has a fan unit, unplug it. If your water heater's electric, unplug it. If there's a cable connection, switch off the power first, then disconnect the cable.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that there have been code changes and other requirements that may apply to the replacement of an existing water heater. First, turn the gas control knob on the water heater to "pilot, " then remove the metal plate and look to see if the pilot is lit. In most cases, you will not need to replace the heater, just repair or replace the parts. Professional installation avoids the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning, explosions, or fire with proper venting, gas lines, and wiring.</p>
<p>Portable water heaters are good choices for adding hot water to out buildings, shops or garages. Turn on a faucet in a nearby room to hot and listen for the heater to turn on.
