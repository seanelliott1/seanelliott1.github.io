<h2>Water Heater Services Saint Clair Shores Michigan</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>The innovative changes in gas valve function to heater designs alone are unequaled. We recommend talking to a licensed professional before making the final decision on a water heater purchase. If your water heater is at least 10 years old, it may be time for an upgrade. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit. Energy savings, endless supply of hot water, low operating cost, reduced risk of power problems, space savings and durability, and safety and assurance are the other advantages.</p>

<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Repair Saint Clair Shores</h3>
<p>Instead of a vent, electric tank-type water heaters have a 220-volt power supply cable going into the top of the hot water storage tank that supplies electricity to the thermostat and heating elements. Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers," are the most common water heaters installed and are used for central heating and can even heat the water for your home using steam. We install these new units all the time, and our customer love how much move it saves them on their utility bills each month.</p>
<p>The water is heated by a couple of electric resistance elements that extend from the side of the tank into the middle of the water. There are times that the pipes cause the issue and not the water heater. Many storage tank water heaters take longer to heat water, because of the larger volume of water they must heat, than most tankless types. For example, if a gas powered tankless water heater is not properly connected to its gas supply line, a gas leak could develop.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
<p>As with any home repair project, water heater replacement is largely dependent on the individual characteristics of the home in which it is being installed. Contact Parkway Mechanical online or call 219-942-6626 to schedule your tankless water heater installation. If you need solar water heater repair or would like one installed, our plumbing experts have you covered. We'll show you how to install your own gas water heater in less than a day.</p>
<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Saint Clair Shores MI</h3>
<p>Doctor Water Heater also provides tankless water heater installation and maintenance.

The units provide as much as 7 gallons of hot water per minute and will never run out of hot water. Cycling losses - the loss of heat as the water circulates through a water heater tank, or inlet and outlet pipes.</p>

<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>

Once the hot water is turned off, the heating elements shift into standby mode until they are needed again.</p>
