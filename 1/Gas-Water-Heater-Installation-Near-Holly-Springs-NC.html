<h2>Water Heater Services Holly Springs North Carolina</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82. In order to get the rebate, however, you must be replacing a conventional tank-type water heater.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Holly Springs</h3>
<p>Tankless heaters are also small and use significantly less space than a large tank water heater. They also lose only 5 percent of their energy compared with a tank unit's 30 percent energy loss. By contrast, installing a conventional electric water heater is within your reach… Provided that you possess some experience in plumbing and electricity. Because the tankless water heater is going to only give the hot water as it is needed instead of having it sit in the tank all the time waiting for you to use it. Then you will not need to worry about having any one getting burnt because they were messing around the hot water tank when they should have not been.</p>
<p>It should be able to provide enough hot water during the busiest time of usage. And a popular fuel choice for this type of water heater is natural gas. By combining a tankless heater and a hot water demand system you get the best of both green worlds, reduced energy consumption and heavy duty water savings. We are happy to replace your troubled water heater with a new unit that is fully warranted and serviced by Mike Diamond Services.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you want it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water daily, according to They also last about two times as long as a tank water heater. To prevent injury, consider installing thermostatic mixing valves. When your shopping for tankless water heaters, the key metric you want to look at is flow rate.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. As shown in the photo, a tankless water heater has its components housed in a steel box that's designed to be mounted on the wall. This means as long as you have water flowing, and don't run out of whatever fuel (propane, electricity, etc.) you use to generate the heat; you have continuous hot water.</p>
<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Holly Springs NC</h3>
<p>There are several different kinds of hot water heaters that come from numerous different companies. Worse, you're probably already aware how deadly gas leaks can be. You can also end up damaging the water heater itself, another costly mistake. It is important that you carefully evaluate your water usage before purchasing your electric hot water heater. For many people, having to repair their water heater is an issue that will sneak up on them.</p>
<p>Most modern tankless water heaters operate in the range of 11,000 to 199,000 BTUs per hour. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, and you fear your existing water heater may not last, I would consider the lower upfront cost of a conventional one, or at most upgrade (for the improved marketability) to the high-efficiency gas storage water heater, rather than incurring the additional expense of a whole-home tankless gas water heater.</p>
<p>Turn OFF the electricity to your water heater at the circuit breaker panel. Replacing your tankless water heating unit should not have to happen often since these models typically last 20 years. Properly operating water heaters are relatively quiet. Tankless water heaters continue to increase in popularity as people learn more about their energy-saving and hot water-providing benefits. Since there's no need to keep the water hot in case it's needed, tankless models consume less energy.</p>

While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty.
