In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>

Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity.

As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
