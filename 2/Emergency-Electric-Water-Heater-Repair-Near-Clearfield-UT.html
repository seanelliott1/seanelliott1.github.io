<h2>Water Heater Services Clearfield Utah</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water.

If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
