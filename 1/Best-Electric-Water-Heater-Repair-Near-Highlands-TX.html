<h2>Water Heater Services Highlands Texas</h2>
<p>A tankless water heater provides water as it is needed. This saves you from needing to drain the entire water heater. While it's usually recommended to stick with a gas water heater if you're concerned about energy costs, it is possible to switch from a gas to an electric water heater in Las Vegas. We have a comprehensive selection of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in multiple sizes, all with excellent warranties and installation.

Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>
