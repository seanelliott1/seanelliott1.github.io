<h2>Water Heater Services Dorchester Center Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Installing a water heater is a common home repair job. Solar water heater consumes energy from the sun. You don't want to simply get the biggest water heater available, as this may be more than you need and you'll still pay to keep the entire tank hot all of the time. Are similar to conventional units in that they both burn gas, exhaust flues and store hot water in an insulated tank. However, from time to time, something can happen which will require you to have to look for a quality water heater repair service.</p>
<p>Flush the heater to remove sediment from the tank. First, your new tank will come with a new T & P valve that is made for your tank so we don't need the old one but we will want to try to salvage our run-off tube that is hooked to the old T & P. If the old and new tank had the T & P hooked into the side of the tank, you should just be able to remove and re-install the tube. Southern California Gas Company offers a rebate of up to $200 on Energy Star-qualified tankless water heaters for models with an energy factor of 0.90 or higher and $150 rebate for models that meet a minimum energy factor of 0.82.
