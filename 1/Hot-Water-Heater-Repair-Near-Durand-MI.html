<p>Thermal couple repair is probably the most common repair on a gas fired water heater. Most, if not all codes require that gas burning equipment be installed where they have enough air to "breathe". The type of fuel required will affect not only the operating costs but also the purchase price of your tankless water heater. If you currently have a water heater that's in fine condition but you are looking to upgrade to a new one, the plumbers at All About Plumbing & Septic are able to help you.</p>

Most tankless water heaters burn either natural gas or propane fuel.</p>
<p>Whether or not you will decide to install a tankless water heater in your home is entirely up to you. There are no extra fees that some Water Heaters Only” providers tack on after removing your leaking tank.
