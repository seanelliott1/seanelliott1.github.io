<h3>Emergency Hot Water Heater Repair Newland</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>In cold climates, with freezing outdoor temperatures, it's more challenging for the heater to provide the hot water your household needs. Lastly, water heater replacement offers you the opportunity to upgrade to an energy-efficient, tankless water heater for endless hot water.

The additional cost to install a gas line and exhaust vent for a gas unit is typically very expensive. It is also possible that the dip tube is broken or damaged and that is allowing the heated to mix with the cold water, creating a lower temperature than desired.</p>
<p>The first thing you'll have to decide when looking at hot water heaters is what type of fuel source you want yours to use. The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>
