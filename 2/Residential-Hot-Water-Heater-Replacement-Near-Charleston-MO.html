<p>3. All tankless water heaters are pretty much the same. Electric units often require a 240 volt electric for the most efficiency. In less time than you would expect, hot water flows out ready to use just as if it came from a storage type heater. Your water heater works hard day and night to keep your family warm and comfortable from the time you wake up and take a shower, to the time you wash your face and get ready for a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>At Super Plumbers, we work with homeowners in Tyler, TX to make sure they have water heater service contractors available when they need it. During the storage of the hot water in the tank, a lot of energy is wasted to keep the water at temperature even if nobody uses it for days since it needs to be heated all the time or it'll become colder by the minute, and these electricity expenses all add up quite quickly to the water bill.</p>
<p>Typically tankless heaters do not have standing pilot lights like tank type units, saving even more energy. For example, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 measures about 14x36x5 inches and may be installed just about anywhere you will find proper electrical and plumbing connections. Reliable - With a properly sized unit, you'll always have a continuous supply of hot water at a preset temperature.
