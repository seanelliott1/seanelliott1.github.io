<p>If you are going to purchase a wholesale tankless water heater then you are going to have to do it with a dealer. TML Service Experts has expertise to fix your water heater and have your household back to normal. A tankless gas water heater lasts around 20 years, while a traditional gas water heater lasts about 15. New systems are often more reliable as well, so you won't have to worry about running out of hot water at inconvenient times.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are a relatively new entrant into the market, but they work quite well for most homeowners. This is true, but, like all man made things, at times, the heater might simply refuse to supply hot water. More Hot Water: Newer water heaters are able to provide you with more hot water. Check the literature for the brand heater you are considering and find the output in gallons per minute (GPM) at the temperature rise you need.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
<p>At Parkway Mechanical, we install state-of-the-art tankless systems, powered by electricity or natural gas, for commercial customers in a variety of industries. Tankless water heaters are increasingly common and can be a great choice to save energy.

<p>If your local water's hardness exceeds 8 grains per gallon, you may need to install a water filter prior to installing the water heater.

Even if your current water heater is traditional, tankless, or electric or gas-powered, you can always add a single-point electric tankless unit under a sink or in a new bathroom as demand increases in your home.</p>
<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time. The only way to know if your current hot w. heater is collecting minerals and deposits is to call a qualified plumber and have them come out and inspect your w. heater.</p>

Traditional tank water heaters can run on gas or electricity. Here at The Hot Water Company, we are taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and can actually serve our great customers without coming in contact with them at all, as most water heaters are located outside or in the garage.</p>
