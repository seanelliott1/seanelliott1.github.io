This means you could pay for two tank heaters in the same time a single tankless model lasts. The cost to install a new water heater ranges from $400 to $900 for a 40 to 50-gallon tank, and between $1,470 and $2,510 for a tankless. If your existing unit has seen better days, a water heater replacement is often the best course of action.</p>

Cold weather Internal heaters keep components toasty down to −22-degrees F, but exposed water pipes must be insulated and wrapped in heat tape that turns on automatically in freezing temperatures.</p>
