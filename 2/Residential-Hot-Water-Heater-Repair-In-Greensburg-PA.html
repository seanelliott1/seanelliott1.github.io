As shown in the photo, a tankless water heater has its components housed in a steel box that's designed to be mounted on the wall.

Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>Using a traditional circulating pump will void the warranty on most tankless heaters, since they will cause the heater to turn on and off very frequently and far more than in typical household usage. If you know you have a recirculating loop for you water heater, it is a good idea to have a ball valve before the point where the loop connects to you water heater.

Water heaters should be serviced regularly in order to preserve their functionality, and repairs may be necessary after substantial use or as the heater grows older, however, they simply don't last forever. Heaters can switch off if there is low water pressure, so the minimum flow rate specification is important here and it has limited capacity for heating.</p>
