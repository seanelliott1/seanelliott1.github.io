Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>And while they cost more than electric-only models, installation is similar and payback time is short. The water heater replenishes supply following use of the stored hot water in the tank. Tankless coil and indirect water heaters - Indirect hot water heaters use the home's space heating system to heat water. Unlimited Hot Water: A traditional water heater will eventually run out of hot water and only work once the tank is refilled.</p>
