You are left with a smile and a new warranty on your professionally installed water heater. Electric tankless water heaters still save homeowners around $44 per year according to the US Department of Energy.

The liquid used in this system, often a form of antifreeze will be cycled through solar panels and then down to the hot water tank. Brass vs. plastic drain valves: These are situated near the base of the water heater for a garden hose that drains the heater.</p>

Not enough hot water may also mean that your water heater is on its last leg and needs to be replaced. With a tankless water heater you can eliminate this heat loss because the water is only heated when you need it. This can end up saving money on your monthly energy bill and conserve energy.</p>
