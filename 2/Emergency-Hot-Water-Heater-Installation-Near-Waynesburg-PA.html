If a hot water faucet is turned on (such as if you take a shower), the water goes through a heat exchanger as it does so, meaning that this type of tankless water heater provides "on-demand" hot water without using a tank; this is something like an "on-demand" heater, but the boiler or furnace in a home heats the water directly, which means that the tankless coil water heater works best during the cold months when a home's heating system is on all or most of the time.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters eliminate the long wait for heat of the traditional hot water tank. 3)The amount of water that the heater allows to flow through is regulated by the desired outlet temperature.
