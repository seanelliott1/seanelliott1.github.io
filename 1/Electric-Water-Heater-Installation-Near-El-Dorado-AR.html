<h2>Water Heater Services El Dorado Arkansas</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are popular options for water heater replacements, and they're only going to become more popular as homeowners discover their numerous advantages. It could be as simple as adjusting the heat so the water gets hotter. When we manage an installation, we actually take the time to remove and drain your old unit before hauling it away. Tankless water heaters are usually powered with electricity or gas.</p>
