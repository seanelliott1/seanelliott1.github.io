<p>The average tankless water heater repair costs $603. A traditional water heater will last up to 10-15 years in your home before it begins to lose efficiency. It's also important to clean out the sediment filter on the heater from time to time. Large households consume a lot of hot water, especially at peak times in the mornings and evenings. This also goes for replacing an old water heater. We offer quick same day service and stock most common water heater parts.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working. That's why it's important to regularly maintain and, if necessary, repair your hot water tank — and that's a task that AirPlus Heating & Cooling can assist you with.
