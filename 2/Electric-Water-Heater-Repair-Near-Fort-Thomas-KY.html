<h2>Water Heater Services Fort Thomas Kentucky</h2>
<p>Although water heaters typically last for a number of years, they do need to be replaced from time to time. A tankless water heater is an excellent option for modern homes: they can keep up with the demand of the majority of households (provided they're sized correctly), cut down on energy bills, and won't run out of hot water the way standard storage tank water heaters do. We are proud to offer top quality installations of tankless water heaters in Bethesda, MD and throughout our wide service area. I don't think there's a best” time to buy a new water heater, but as with any appliance, around major holidays (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.) are usually good times.</p>
<p>Electric tankless water heaters are cheaper than the gas versions. Save more with exclusive offers and valuable coupons from Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning. If you have a gas water heater make certain the gas is off and pilot light is not on before you do anything. Never attempt to repair or replace your water heater yourself. Noritz green water heaters will achieve around a 30 percent reduction in energy use and save consumers approximately $108 annually, compared to traditional tank water heaters.</p>
<p>A local plumbing company such as Atlas Home Services eliminates the guesswork—and the hassle—around replacing your old water heater. By some estimates, a tankless hot water heater uses 22% less energy than its traditional counterpart. Whether you are in of water heater repairs or you're interested in upgrading to a newer, more efficient tankless model, our expert plumbing technicians can help. Check the Energy Factor (EF) to see how efficient the unit is. A higher EF rating indicates better efficiency.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Fort Thomas</h3>
<p>Homeowners looking to save on water heating expenses. Most gas tankless water heaters fall between 95,000-195,000 BTUs. Now though, if you need to repair or replace your heater, both Morco and Bosch have ceased production of these models. A standard water heater has to keep a constant supply of heat to the water inside the tank in order to have it at the right temperature when you need to take a hot shower or wash the dishes.</p>
<p>If you're starting to see the signs below, it's time to think about replacing your water heater. This is largely due to the increased amount of energy required to operate a tankless heater when it's in use. Some state laws require replacement water heaters to be anchored or braced to resist movement during an earthquake, which can cause gas or water line leaks and electrical wiring damage. If your household consumes a great deal of hot water and needs it from more than one outlet at a time then don't purchase a standard tankless water heater.</p>
<p>Call now and we'll be there soon to help you get your hot water back on and to alleviate your worries about your water heater. Your local Aire Serv technician can help you determine whether your water heater is a suitable candidate for repair or replacement.

The gas connection is the piping that connects to your existing gas service, which will be extended to your heater.</p>
<p>That isn't a problem with us. We know all of the proper procedures for gas water heater repairs. Finally, your installer or electrician can connect your new tankless water heater to your home's electrical systems. The water doesn't pool in the tank as it does with a standard tank type of water heater where it must fill the tank to a certain level before the heating element even starts. No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.). Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>

<p>This is especially true for those units that have gone without proper maintenance or repairs when needed. That's 2X the life of a traditional hot water heater. When long-term costs matter, the electric tankless water heater is the most cost-effective option, but is not the most efficient fuel source. Gas or electric demand units average about the same cost to purchase. Each type of water heater has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>For residential applications, the hot water set point temperature should be only slightly above the highest temperature needed for domestic uses. A lot of times when this happens, its because the necessary repairs and maintenance were not scheduled for your water heater. Since the issue just started after you installed the tankless water heater, I would highly recommend calling the water heater company and asking them to come to take a look.</p>

You waste more water because tankless heaters have to heat the water first since there isn't a tank full already waiting. Answers to this issue are turning up the heat dial on the water heater, insulating the hot water pipes, moving the water heater, installing a second water heater or adding a recirculating pump system.</p>
<p>The gas tankless water heater installation cost would be in the $1200 to $3000 range if switching from electric to gas. The tankless unit also uses a PVC flue pipe, which can be installed when a standard chimney is either not available or not practical. Water heaters are not products that are meant to last for a lifetime, thus, there are times in which your water heater will need to be repaired. At PV, we perform high quality, professionally audited installations of natural gas tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. A tankless heater has a flow sensing device that is activated whenever a hot water tap is opened. A tankless heater only uses energy while it's heating water. Then, the temperature of your water will slowly decrease until the hot water in the tank has been completely replaced with "cold" water. These water heaters come up 98% efficient and once running will provide you with an endless stream of hot water.</p>
<p>A tankless heater can reduce the wait time” for hot water for your shower or any other use. Safety - With tankless water heaters there is virtually no chance of your child or anyone else being scalded by hot water out of the tap. There are some common mistakes that homeowners make with their water heaters that should be avoided. If the tankless water heater doesn't properly vent out exhaust gases from the heat exchanger, it can cause the heat exchanger to corrode, and this can be potentially harmful to your house.</p>
<p>Electric tankless hot water installation can similarly run into a variety of problems if it is not wired by professionals. A tankless water heater is a system of heating your household water that doesn't require the standard water tank of a traditional system. Your water heater is one of the most important parts of your home. Heater Size: If your unit is too small, it will not be able to heat water efficiently.</p>
