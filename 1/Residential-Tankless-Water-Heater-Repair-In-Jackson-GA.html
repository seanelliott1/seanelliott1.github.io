A tankless water heater may be the right option for you. Currently, there is too little data to accurately estimate life expectancy for tankless water heaters, but preliminary data shows that tankless water heaters could last up to 20 years.</p>

<p>The majority of people don't have their water heater stored in a conspicuous place so the color is of lesser importance and the appearance is not relevant either. On the other hand, tankless heater works in better efficient as water is heated on demand. If a heater isn't equipped with a built-in neutralizing cartridge, the installer has to add one. However, you should consider your usage preferences, energy supply, and space considerations when talking with your local water heater service provider.</p>
<p>Electric tankless units can potentially help you save on home energy use and provide continuous hot water on demand. Leaks - If you're finding water around the base of your hot water tank, then your water heater has most likely already corroded beyond the ability for a repair. It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. Some of them have the anode installed in a separate opening on top of the tank and some use a combination anode rod that is installed in the hot water outlet of the tank.</p>
<p>Conventional hot water heaters keep water in storage tanks at a set temperature and distribute hot water on an as-needed basis. Replace your standard water heater with an electric fired tankless water heater. Normally, gas-type water heater last up to 12 years. Hot water temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit can cause serious burns.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>

So, when it comes to the selection and installation of your new water heater, you should rely on the experts America trusts for water heater services.</p>
