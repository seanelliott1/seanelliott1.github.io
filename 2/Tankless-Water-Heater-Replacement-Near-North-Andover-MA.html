<h2>Water Heater Services North Andover Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>Hot water is hot water but it does make a difference in the ultimate price you pay in energy bills which type of hot water heater you choose. While tankless water heaters are a great alternative to traditional tank water heaters, there are some things to consider before you purchase and allow Barstow and Sons to install them professionally. As with any other appliance or component of your home, proper maintenance is essential to maximize the lifespan of your water heater.</p>
<p>I need to purchase a new water heater SOON. Energy Saving: You'll notice the difference in your electricity bill since you don't have to heat up an entire tank of water. Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>

Old age - is one of the main reasons to go for water heater repair. 50 Gallon water Heaters that are run by electric are often a popular choice of homeowners and new home builders.

<p>That isn't a problem with us. We know all of the proper procedures for gas water heater repairs.

The water doesn't pool in the tank as it does with a standard tank type of water heater where it must fill the tank to a certain level before the heating element even starts. No hot water - Check to see that your home and tank's water supply is uninterrupted, and the tank's power source is functioning (check the fuse box or gas burner unit, etc.). Try turning the unit off then back on again.</p>

<p>A 50 gallon water heater can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours for electric or 30 to 60 minutes for gas to heat water to 120 degrees. It really depends on the brand you buy, and the cost of the model purchased, but a traditional water heater will last 10 to 13 years, and a tankless water heater will generally last up to 20 years. If the circuit breaker or fuse repeatedly blows out, call a qualified electrician to check and repair the circuit.</p>
<p>Thanks to the low emission of potentially health-threatening elements tankless water heaters are environment-friendly. If your current hot water heater cannot meet your needs, new water heater installation is likely the best choice. Higher installation cost - You might run into a higher installation cost because of venting requirements, as well as the placement of additional tankless units around the home.
