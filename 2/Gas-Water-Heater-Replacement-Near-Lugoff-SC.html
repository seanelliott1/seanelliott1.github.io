<h2>Water Heater Services Lugoff South Carolina</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>One of the things to consider when planning a water heater installation project is the installation cost. Press the black probe firmly against the metal tank or the heating element mounting nuts or screws (not the other terminal screw). There are some elements that set each type of water heater a apart from one another. If your old water heater used copper piping, you may choose to plumb it with copper piping again.</p>

<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Lugoff SC</h3>
<p>Turn off the water and gas or electric before you begin, and take particular care to vent gas models properly.

With an electric hot water heater, several other components could be causing you to lose hot water. Solar water heaters work using roof-mounted solar panels that absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to an antifreeze-like fluid in a closed-loop system that runs to the water tank and heats the water.</p>

<p>Similar to the video directly above, it also shows how to test the thermostat and elements, but it does a particularly good job of showing details such as the exact screws and terminals to test with a multimeter and how to use the multimeter. If a gas water heater is incorrectly vented, hot gases can present a fire danger inside the walls. Until, of course, the water heater suddenly stops working, and all that hot water that once flowed freely is nothing but a near-freezing stream — not something you're thrilled to take a shower in.</p>
<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
