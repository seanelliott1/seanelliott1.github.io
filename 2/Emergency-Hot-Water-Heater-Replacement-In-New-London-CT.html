<h2>Water Heater Services New London Connecticut</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most common and easiest way to heat water is by the use of a gas hot water heater, and this might be due to the fact that gas is capable of getting the tank up to operating temperature roughly twice as quickly as its electric counterpart, and the cost is also approximately half as much as electricity would cost. Tank water heaters are great and very reliable, but if you are looking for a more energy-efficient that can save you a lot of money, tankless water heaters are the way to go. At All About Plumbing & Septic, we are able to repair and replace tankless water heaters, as well as provide quality water heater installation service More and more people are investing in tankless water heaters because when it's not in use, it doesn't consume energy; with traditional tank water heaters, they are constantly heating water within in a tank.</p>
<p>Water is leaking from the hot water heater tank. However, as long as your water usage at any given time is below the maximum allowable flow rate, tankless water heaters provide an endless supply of hot water. This is often provided by either a flame, on a gas water heater, or a heating element, on an electric water heater. They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>
<p>If you have an older model water heater it may be time to replace rather than keep repairing. If the water is still as hot as it was before you turned the temperature down, it's because the thermostat isn't working.

<p>Typically, you'll have a choice between gas, electric, tankless, and even solar-powered water heaters. Since the tank is the only part of the system that can actually force you to replace the water heater, be sure to troubleshoot before you buy a new unit. There is also a range of fuel sources that can heat water such as solar, gas, electricity and wood. Also known as instantaneous water heater, the heater heats the water on demand.</p>
<p>With a tank-style hot water heater, water is heated in a tank and stored until it is needed. Electric water heaters are powered by standard electricity to heat and cool the water that flows to your tubs, showers, sinks, dishwasher, and washing machine.

Beyond the initial cost, the national average for the installation of a tankless unit is slightly over $1,700. A problem one contractor might solve with an inexpensive replacement of a sacrificial anode could inspire another, less scrupulous contractor to solve by recommending a brand new (and expensive) water heater.</p>
