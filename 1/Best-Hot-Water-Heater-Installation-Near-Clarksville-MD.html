Heat pump water heaters, also called hybrid electric water heaters , capture heat from the air or ground and transfer it to the water. A tankless water heater doesn't store water and heats it only when you need it. There are natural gas, electricity, propane heaters for you to choose from and they store from 20 to 120 gallons of water, depending on the size of the tank.</p>
