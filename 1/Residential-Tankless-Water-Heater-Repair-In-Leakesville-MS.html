<h2>Water Heater Services Leakesville Mississippi</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>As with many household devices, water heaters become more expensive to maintain as they get older. For this reason, you need a repair expert who is experienced in handling tankless style heaters, and that's exactly what HomeWorks water heater repair technicians can offer you. Whereas your normal tank for replacement can be had anywhere from $150 to over $1000, plus installation costs of $200 to $400, an instant model will run from about $400 - $3000 with additional costs for installation, particularly if the supply lines and venting options for gas are not adequate.</p>
<p>It might seem like it would be easy to install a water heater, but it is actually a lot more complex than it looks. According to , For homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily, demand (or tankless) water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters.” Tankless water heaters (if gas-fired) will save homeowners over $100 annually the longer they remain in service.</p>
<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Repair Leakesville</h3>
<p>If the water coming out of your faucets is way too hot or it steams, it's possible that the water heater isn't shutting off at the temperature it's supposed to. This is probably because the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is malfunctioning. The most common complaint regarding a water heater is that it doesn't produce enough hot water. Our factory trained technicians provide 24 hour emergency service on all makes and models, and same day replacement with no charge for removal and disposal of your old water heater.</p>
<p>In cold climates, with freezing outdoor temperatures, it's more challenging for the heater to provide the hot water your household needs. Lastly, water heater replacement offers you the opportunity to upgrade to an energy-efficient, tankless water heater for endless hot water. Our plumbing experts will provide you with full service drain cleaning solutions. On the flip side, you'll have to invest around $3,000 upfront, they provide inconsistent water temperature in many situations, and leave you without any hot water during a power outage.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
<p>A heat pump water heater is a few inches to a foot taller than a conventional electric water heater and requires a certain ceiling height based on the size of the water heater - which is dependent on household size. Caution: Be sure to turn off the power at your circuit breaker or shut off the gas before doing any kind of water heater inspection. No venting is required for A. Smith electric tankless water heaters.</p>
