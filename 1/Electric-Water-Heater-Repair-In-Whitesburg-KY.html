Indirect water heaters cost $800 to $1,500 on average. If the buildup is left unattended and the tank has rusted, it is time for a new water heater altogether. Remember that water heaters for home use need lower electrical ratings compared to commercial applications.</p>
<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>
<p>Our team of preventative maintenance specialists will give your tankless water heater a checkup every year to make sure you always have hot water whenever you want it.

Some models, known as single point units, install close to the water source and are fairly inexpensive to purchase and install.
