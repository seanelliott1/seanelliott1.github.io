<p>This type of heater uses a powerful electric heating element to instantly heat the incoming water just before it exits the shower head. Then install the new element, using the wrench to tighten it, and reconnect the wires (Photo 5). Close the drain valve and fill the tank before switching on the circuit breaker. Instead of storing and heating a tank of water for access throughout the home, a tankless hot water heater heats the water on demand, as it passes through the unit.</p>
<p>Heat pump water heaters qualify as tank-type water heaters and are powered by electricity. You turn on the shower and feel warm water at first, but then get blasted with several seconds of cold water before the temperature slowly climbs back up. Here's what happened: When the first shower ended, some hot water was remaining in the pipes on the way to the shower. Call your local water heating experts at B&B Heating & Cooling.</p>
