<h2>Water Heater Services West Palm Beach Florida</h2>
<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>
<p>We've been working in and around the Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo area for over 20 years, and in that time have refined our services to become the best. If however, the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat, the lower thermostat switches "on" and sends voltage to the lower heating element (a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be "calling") and heats the water.</p>
<p>With hot water pipes adequately insulated with materials like foam pipe insulation sleeves, your plumber can help your home become more energy efficient. Similar to gas-fired tank-type systems, gas-fired tankless systems include a vent that removes any by-products created during the combustion process. Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2-5 gallons (7.6-15.2 liters) per minute. If your electric hot water heater is slow to heat, runs out of hot water faster than it used to, or doesn't deliver any hot water at all, there's a 90 percent chance that simply replacing one or both of the heating elements will solve the problem.</p>

There is no need for a storage tank nor is there any energy wasted on heat loss with the tankless heating systems. Hot water heaters heat up the water supplied by your friendly utilities company, allowing you to do things like luxuriate in hot, candle-lit bathtubs, wash beautiful bone china, and keep yourself in a steady supply of clean underwear.</p>
<p>However, if you're considering an electric tankless water heater, you'll need to make sure your home's electric panel can handle the added load.

<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency West Palm Beach FL</h3>
<p>Typically, you'll have a choice between gas, electric, tankless, and even solar-powered water heaters.

There is also a range of fuel sources that can heat water such as solar, gas, electricity and wood. Also known as instantaneous water heater, the heater heats the water on demand.</p>
<p>If your water heater has already exceeded its 15-year life expectancy or has developed a major problem, a replacement is the clear choice. When this happens, it is imperative that you call Aaaction Plumbing for water heater repair in Spring, TX immediately. Traditional storage water heaters produce heat energy losses that cost you money. There is a real possibility that your home's existing gas line, gas meter, and piping are not appropriately sized to handle the high demand for gas that a tankless water heater would require.</p>

<p>Double check the voltage on the circuit in the home's electrical panel and at the point it connects to the heater - most are 240 volts.
