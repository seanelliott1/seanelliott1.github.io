<p>Water heaters can only be installed by an appropriately licensed plumbing contractor or registered plumbing worker and they must provide the household and the Office of the Technical Regulator with a certificate of compliance for the installation within seven days of completing the work. When you turn on a hot water valve or an appliance that draws hot water such as a washing machine or dishwasher, the gas-fired tankless water heater will draw cold water in through the cold-water inlet pipe on one side.</p>
<p>The basic premise behind a tankless heater is that the water is not forced to stay within a tank, being heated and reheated until it's used. High Recovery Water Heaters Make sure your water heater meets your household demands with a high recovery rate. As a result, tankless heaters are able to supply a constant stream of hot water.

The two pipes coming out of the top of every water heater tank are the supply and delivery pipes ; one is the cold-water inlet pipe and the other is the hot-water outlet pipe The cold-water inlet pipe carries cold water from your home's water supply into the tank where it comes out of the dip tube , filling the tank with water to be heated.</p>
