They use electricity to pump heat from the air or the ground to your water tank, using less energy than traditional water heaters.</p>

Whenever we provide water heater replacement and installation services in Chattanooga, TN, you can expect nothing less than superior service. First, we help you size your tankless water heater based on the average simultaneous flow rate you require. But today's tankless water heater makes Ruud's invention seem hopelessly bulky and inefficient.</p>
<p>If you are installing an electric water heater, which requires 240-volt electrical power, have an electrician route the wiring to it unless you are certain of your skills. Like HVAC systems, a poorly functioning water heater can affect your utility bills. The number of hot-water fixtures it can serve at one time will depend upon the heating capacity of the unit. Because electric water heaters use electricity to operate, the problem you're experiencing may actually be caused by an electrical issue instead of the water heater itself.</p>
<p>Be careful to ensure that your water heater is convenient and safe in case of future servicing. Remember, with tankless, there is no preheated reservoir of water. Once you close the hot water tap, the unit senses that the flow of water has stopped and shuts off the heating element. Get up to 36 months to pay for your new water heater, subject to credit approval. Condensing water heaters have a tank like a conventional storage tank water heater, but they capture hot exhaust gases that would normally be expelled from a home out the flue.</p>

As long as these needs are met, it is convenient for tankless water heating to take place in the bathroom. These water heaters operate in tandem with your home heating system and are often seen in conjunction with boilers. There are ways to prevent sediment buildup, including regular maintenance, using a water softener to reduce the number of contaminants in your water, and keeping your overall water heater temperature at or below 130 degrees.</p>
<p>Small apartments or limited use, such as in the case of having a single source for hot water access, may benefit from a single-point hot water tank. Tankless heaters last up to twenty-five years or more. Call (630) 577-9241 or (815) 609-1859 to discuss your water heater installation options. Even better, if your unit needs a boost to improve hot water production, our team can recommend and install attachments to increase efficiency.</p>
