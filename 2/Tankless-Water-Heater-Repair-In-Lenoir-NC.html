<h2>Water Heater Services Lenoir North Carolina</h2>
<p>Like any other things on the world, a hot water heater tank has its own parts. If a hot water faucet is turned on (such as if you take a shower), the water goes through a heat exchanger as it does so, meaning that this type of tankless water heater provides "on-demand" hot water without using a tank; this is something like an "on-demand" heater, but the boiler or furnace in a home heats the water directly, which means that the tankless coil water heater works best during the cold months when a home's heating system is on all or most of the time.</p>
<p>At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning, we are your reliable water heater experts in Merriam. Turn the faucets on at the knobs and allow hot and cold water to flow through the new heater.

<p>A tankless water heater can place a virtually unlimited supply of hot water within your reach 24 hours a day while saving you time, energy, money, and space. First of all, it is important to understand the basic operation of a tankless water heater. New storage tank water heaters are required to operate more efficiently, and tankless (on-demand) water heaters are even more efficient than that. This indicates what sort of energy source is used to heat the water.</p>
<p>Also known as instant heaters, they do not produce the standby energy losses you are likely to find with traditional heaters, thereby saving you money. To make sure your water heater is restored properly, schedule an appointment with our plumbing experts. In some cases, however, the water heater may need to be replaced. A high-temperature limit switch down by the viewing door at the bottom of the tank should protect the water heater from overheating.</p>
<p>Some of these heaters are more energy efficient than other kinds. The purchase price of gas powered heaters may be a little bit higher, but they are cheaper to operate overall. Also, since combustion takes place in the heating process using gas there needs to be adequate ventilation for both combustion (fresh air flow) and exhaust.
