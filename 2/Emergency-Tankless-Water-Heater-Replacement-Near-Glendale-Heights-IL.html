<h2>Water Heater Services Glendale Heights Illinois</h2>
<p>Tankless water heaters, both gas and electric, are pretty much in demand these days, as they are considered to be one of the most energy efficient appliances available today. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones. Some popular models include Bosch Aquastar 2400ES Gas Tankless Water Heater, GE Indoor Tankless Gas Water Heater Model GN94DNSRSA and Rheem Tankless Water Heater RTG-74PVN-1, Indoor Use. Water Heater- Install what you are taking out if you have a 40 gallon and want to upgrade to a 50 gallon now is the time to do it. If you do have a 50 gallon I DO NOT recommend switching to anything lower than what you have.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>The maintenance necessary for your water heater depends on location, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and manufacturer recommendations. You usually notice a leak when there is a puddle around the bottom of the water heater or they may be a trail leading back to the tank. Note: Unless the water heater stopped working more than a few hours ago, the water spilling out will be hot. Instead of storing heated water in tank, it supplies water only when needed.</p>

<p>Touch red probe to the power screw terminal of heating element and black probe to the power screw terminal of thermostat.
