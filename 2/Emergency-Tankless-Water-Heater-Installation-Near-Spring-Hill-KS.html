Gas hot water heater installation (hot water heater system replacement) is NOT a DIY (do-it-yourself) project. There is no need to wait until your hot water heater breaks down or becomes inefficient. Simply put, changing the size of your water heater is usually not an option in an RV. Install a shutoff valve to the cold water inlet. If you're relatively inexperienced, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills.</p>
