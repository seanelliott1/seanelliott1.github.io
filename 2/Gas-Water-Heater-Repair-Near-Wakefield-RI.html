<p>When your hot water heater breaks, you will know that something isn't right when there is no hot water coming from your faucets. By heating water on demand, no water tank was necessary. There are things you can buy to get around this issue, but for the most part, the tankless water heater is only going to generate heat when it's needed.

<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as demand-type or instantaneous water heaters, provide hot water only as it is needed. As shown in the photo, a tankless water heater has its components housed in a steel box that's designed to be mounted on the wall. This means as long as you have water flowing, and don't run out of whatever fuel (propane, electricity, etc.) you use to generate the heat; you have continuous hot water.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Wakefield Rhode Island 02879</h3>
<p>A good rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the lifespan of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. However, a single tankless unit provides a limited flow of hot water per minute - between two and five gallons. Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
