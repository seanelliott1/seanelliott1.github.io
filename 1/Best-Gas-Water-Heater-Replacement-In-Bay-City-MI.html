Units with increased energy efficiency and upgraded features, like hybrid models, may also raise the unit's price. Our proficient plumbing specialists can complete any water heater repair that comes our way in Kingston. There are two types of tankless water heaters: electric and gas-fired. A Tankless water heater uses a heat source (electric or gas) to warm up cool water on-demand whenever you need it rather than storing hot water in a tank.</p>
<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>

Use teflon tape on the connecting portion of the valve if it doesn't quite fit into the heater.</p>

Only gas can produce enough hot water for a large home. Contact us anytime you think your water heater needs repair service.

Whether you have a gas, propane, or electric water heater, there might be times when you wish you had more hot water to work with.</p>
<p>When replacing a storage tank heater, the existing venting is often galvanized sheet metal that can oxidize or rust over a long period of time, if condensation collects inside it. The new tankless models are condensing units that are up to 92 percent more efficient, making their exhaust temperature only about 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>

Another very common water heater repair issue is no hot water. First, check the water heater's circuit breaker in the service panel to make sure it hasn't tripped. The first question when shopping for a new water heater is whether you want to go with a tank or tankless model.</p>
