<h2>Water Heater Services Kannapolis North Carolina</h2>
<p>The only time most people really spend thinking about their water heaters is in the middle of winter, when they get up in the dark to take a hot shower and they're blasted with a jet of icy water. Regardless of the power source, the water stored in their tank will remain hot for several days. If there's a major problem with your water heater or it's more than 12-15 years old, it may be time to consider a new one. On average, natural gas and propane models have an installation cost of around $1,000 to $1,500. These advancements have significantly increased the number of available residential and commercial hot water heating solutions.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters eliminate the long wait for heat of the traditional hot water tank. 3)The amount of water that the heater allows to flow through is regulated by the desired outlet temperature. Condensing water heaters are an option if you heat with gas and need a unit with a capacity of more than 55 gallons. Planet Plumbing & Drain offers hot water heater replacement services in Boulder, Longmont and Denver metro areas.</p>
<p>Coat the threaded ends with pipe joint compound and screw the first nipple into the gas valve. We've taken a closer look at the best tank versus tankless heaters so you can narrow your search and find the perfect water heater for your home and lifestyle. Periodic water heater maintenance can significantly extend your water heater's life and minimize loss of efficiency. Water heaters are heavy. The fuel used by a water heating system will not only affect annual operation costs but also the water heater's size and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Our team can replace your water heater with a newer, more efficient model that meets or exceeds your needs. We have continuous training in new water heater technology and repair techniques to ensure you get the highest quality services. First of all, the tankless unit is more costly. Our team is licensed, bonded, and insured and provides guaranteed tankless water heater installations. The cost of installation is quite expensive.</p>
<p>The new tankless water heaters are great for providing you with hot water instantly by heating the water right inside of the pipe as soon as you turn the faucet on. While they are more expensive than traditional units, the amount of money you will save on your water bill and your electricity or gas bill will be well worth the added investment. Storage tank water heaters have an energy factor of 0.59, on average.</p>
<p>Gallons Per Minute (GPM) represents the amount of hot water a tankless water heater provides per minute. If the extra costs of installing a tankless system are going to outweigh your potential savings, you may want to consider a tank system or a high-efficiency tank system. Gas heaters are touted as being more economical and environmentally friendly than electric, but they also have more components that may wear out or fail.</p>
<p>Most people make a healthy investment when buying and installing an new water heater for their home or business. If there's a problem with your water heater, all you have to do is pick up the phone and give us a call. Using the purchase price, annual energy cost, and an estimated cost of installation, we calculated the payback time for both new and replacement installations. A tankless water heater is designed to heat water so incredibly fast that you don't need a storage tank.</p>
<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Kannapolis NC</h3>
<p>This figure is more important than the tank capacity for determining whether a particular hot water heater will meet your needs. We carry a variety of the conventional water heaters to meet every need. This model is also referred to as a demand-type” or instant” water heater, and provides hot water by heating up cold water as it passes through the unit, as opposed to storing it in a tank like a traditional unit would.</p>
<p>Available throughout the United States - most abundantly in the Southwest - for solar water heaters. Noritz is also well-respected in the field for developing some of the safest tankless water heaters on the market. A PV team member also audits every tankless water heater installation after it's complete. They're also better suited for use with natural gas, though they may require installation of a larger diameter gas line, a potentially costly endeavor.</p>
<p>With a Rinnai tankless hot water heater, you can expect to have up to 9.8 gallons of hot water per minute. At the same time, they provide reliable hot water that never runs out. The company's tank water heaters are available exclusively at Home Depot. There are usually two heating elements inside the storage tank, one located near the bottom and one located in the middle of the tank. Tankless water heaters last 15 to 20 years.</p>

If your water heater is constantly breaking down, requiring repairs, it's time to replace it. You will save money on repair bills with a new unit.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason. While tankless hot water heaters are generally more efficient than conventional water heaters, we can help you maintain your conventional water heater, or install a new conventional water heater, in a manner that will allow your conventional water heater to run just as efficiently as many tankless hot water heaters.</p>
<p>If you ever see boiling water coming out of your faucet, or can see steam, you need to turn off your heater immediately and get a professional to inspect it. Boiling water usually means that the thermostat is broken and is overheating. We eliminate the stress and fear of replacing your water heater, by making the repair a fast, friendly, and comfortable experience. This means that the cause is somewhere between the water heater and the fixtures.</p>
<p>That's where tankless, often called on-demand,” water heaters come in. You can get a low-end 50-gallon tank water heater for around $500 but a top-of-the-line Rinnai or Navien may cost around $1,500. Your water heater does not supply hot water constantly. With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>When picking out a water heater, pay attention to the energy efficiency rating of the models you're considering. You'll get several significant benefits from hiring a professional with experience for your water heater installation rather than trying it yourself if you haven't connected a water heater before. They constantly heat water so hot water is consistently available. With a gas water heater, there could be many other issues, and many of these can be a huge problem that you are going to want to get checked out.</p>
