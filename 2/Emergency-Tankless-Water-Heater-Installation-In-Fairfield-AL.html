You're also not as limited when it comes to where your tankless water heater can be installed as they're safer. In addition to choosing a water heater with a good warranty, check consumer reporting websites and reviews from individual owners. The first step is to find an appropriate wall to mount the water heater to. For a whole house water heater, it makes sense to place it close to where most hot water is being used.</p>
<p>I spoke with a technician who has seen tankless water heaters fail due to hard water deposits in as little as two years here in Minnesota. Similarly, in case you find a pool of water on the floor where your electric water heater is installed, you should urgently call a plumber, as it again is a crisis situation.

<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>

<p>It can be complicated removing old water heaters because they can weigh over 150 pounds and can release scalding-hot water if handled improperly. Hot water heaters are available in different models that are powered by solar energy, gas and electricity.
