<h2>Water Heater Services Great Neck New York</h2>
<p>A gas hot water heater is the most common type you will find in most households. The best way to prevent emergency water heater repairs is to schedule regular maintenance for your system. Long lasting - Traditional tank water heating systems generally come with a warranty of up to 6 years. Here, the water is heated using either a gas burner or electric element as it passes through. If you've had enough of waiting for your water tank to heat the water, there is the option of a tankless water heater.</p>
<p>3. If you are not getting the same hot water as you used to, then you probably need a new heater or to at least have it checked. Like our other services, your new water heater will be backed by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee for a year. There are several key operational differences between tankless and conventional heaters. When you're enjoying quality family time, the last thing you need is a plumbing emergency.</p>
<p>Flow rate- Flow rate is how many gallons of hot water a tankless water heater can produce in 1 minute. Tankless water heaters operate by turning on as a hot water tap or appliance is activated, heating the water through a heat exchanger as it is moved to the faucet, dishwasher, washing machine, or shower head. Be sure to look into tankless water heaters because, with this type, you never run out of hot water.</p>
<h3>Affordable Tankless Water Heater Replacement Great Neck</h3>
<p>If your family has grown larger or smaller, this is a good time to consider upsizing or downsizing your water heater. A traditional water heater stores hot water in a large tank. You'll need to have the water heater cleaned out, but we also strongly recommend installing a water softener to eliminate the problem at the source. With tankless electric water heaters, there is a direct relationship between the flow rate of a fixture (demand), the power supplied to the tankless electric water heater, and the output temperature of the hot water.</p>
<p>That's why we're always around to help with water heater repairs and maintenance. The design of the hot water plumbing system gets very simple and straight forward due to the advances introduced with the DHC-E. If it takes more than a minute, you should contact the installer to see if there's an opportunity to adjust the settings so that you can access hot water more quickly. The only factor that adds to tankless water heater cost is the installation, and even this can be manipulated to be less.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are energy efficient compared to traditional water heating systems, as they do not work until a hot water faucet is turned on. Regular maintenance can keep your tankless unit going up to 20 years — twice as long as standard storage water heaters. That's because of their reputation for running more efficiently, an appealing characteristic given that heating water is the average U.S. home's second highest utility cost after heating and cooling the house itself.</p>
<p>If your water heater is old and breaks down, you may be better off replacing it, as the average repair costs more than half the average cost of replacement. Assured Comfort repairs and services all brands of residential and commercial hot water heaters.

If you're old water heater pipe is damaged or not compatible with the new system, you will have to purchase new piping ($8-$10 per linear foot).</p>

<p>2. Electrical tankless water heaters can require upgraded electrical service of much higher amperage than you currently have. When replacing a water heater it's easiest to keep the same fuel type and roughly the same size, although you can usually change the size a bit — for example, from 40 to 50 gallons, provided there is enough room for the heater. Your energy savings depends on the amount of water you use and the efficiency of your previous tank-style system.</p>

It is so compact it fits right under the vanity and will supply endless hot water to both sinks.

Space Savers: Tankless water heater installation is more convenient because these small systems can easily be installed under a sink or in a cabinet - taking a fraction of the space of your traditional system.</p>
<p>T&P Valve usually comes with the new heaters. The tankless water heater is going to end up saving you money if you choose to have one in place in your home or business.

Electric radiant heating is generally used to retrofit a single room, like a bathroom, den or kitchen. It could be drawing too much power from the circuit or there could be a fault in the wiring or water heater. I opted to just fix the heating element to allow time to save up for a new hot water heater that will inevitably be needed.</p>
<p>Gas units just heat water faster than electric, tankless or otherwise. A traditional water heater has an average lifespan of 10 to 15 years, but they can fail without warning. When it comes to quality, Noritz takes no short cuts in producing the highest quality tankless water heaters. A properly installed and insulated conventional water heater will save you money on your energy bills without requiring any modifications to your existing ventilation, power supply, or gas supply.</p>
