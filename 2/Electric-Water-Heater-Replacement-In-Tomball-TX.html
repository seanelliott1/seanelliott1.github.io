The good news is that newer hot water heaters aren't overly expensive and they will last for over a decade, making them a very good investment.</p>

Typically, tankless systems run on either electric or gas. On the other hand, storage water tank is best when you need hot water in the kitchen and bathrooms throughout the day.</p>
