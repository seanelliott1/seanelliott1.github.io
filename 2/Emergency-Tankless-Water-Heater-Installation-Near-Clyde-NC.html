<h2>Water Heater Services Clyde North Carolina</h2>
<p>A tankless water heater provides water as it is needed. This saves you from needing to drain the entire water heater. While it's usually recommended to stick with a gas water heater if you're concerned about energy costs, it is possible to switch from a gas to an electric water heater in Las Vegas. We have a comprehensive selection of gas and electric tank water heaters offered in multiple sizes, all with excellent warranties and installation. Sure, I said it wasn't the only reason to make the change, but solar heaters are undoubtedly a wonderful green choice.</p>
<p>Usually, these tanks hold enough hot water to meet the needs of the entire house. When we install a new water heater, our water heater experts will ensure that any gas and electrical connections are handled safely, and the water heater is installed properly. Endless hot water and lower energy bills are two reasons homeowners are switching to tankless water heaters. You can enjoy consistent hot water by scheduling professional service when it's needed.</p>
<p>Attach the vent pipe to the draft hood on the water heater (for gas water heaters only). A properly sized unit with sufficient air and gas inputs will provide efficient, on-demand hot water for your customers, leading to increased comfort and long-term savings. Now it's time to establish the cold (usually right side) and hot (usually left side) water connections. On a chilly day, it can take several minutes for hot water to travel from the hot water heater tank to your shower.</p>

The use of WELS (Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards) 3 star rated water saving shower head is an important factor in saving water and energy whilst reducing the size and cost of the hot water installation required. As a rule, if you've spent half the cost of a new water heater on repairs, or if your water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to replace your unit.</p>
<p>Water underneath the water heater is almost always a sure sign that your water heater needs replacing. Raise the gas burner or the lower heating element on an electric water heater at least eighteen inches above the floor if the equipment is in the garage. In large homes however, you might need more than one for a proper supply of hot water. Generally residential water heaters have a life expectancy of 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Petri Plumbing & Heating, Inc. Tankless water heaters heat only the water you use, rather than heating and storing water continuously. That being said, although it is a simple process, dealing with gas or electricity and water should always be handled by a professional. A like-for-like gas water heater system installation in the same spot will typically have a gas hot water heater installation cost between $250 and $700.</p>
<p>However, they can reduce energy consumption by as much as 30 percent, by only heating water when it is needed rather than keeping a tank of hot water constantly heated. This is known as standby energy loss and it's costing you money. Tankless water heaters, also known as "on demand" heaters, heat water without a storage tank, using energy only when needed - rather than maintaining a tank of hot water. Tankless water heaters, also called on-demand water heaters, make hot water only when you need it. They're 24 to 34 percent more efficient when added to homes that consume less than 41 gallons of hot water every day, according to They also last about twice as long as a tank water heater.</p>

<p>In Denver, any plumber who is licensed by the Colorado Plumbing Board and the City and County of Denver can handle almost all water heater problems. As the water heats, pressure builds inside the tank. The first tankless water heaters were only about two feet by three feet and bumped out from the wall about 12 or more inches. This means your water heater won't have to work as hard to heat your home's water, so an electrical model will likely work fine for most Atlanta homes.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Clyde North Carolina 28721</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play.

<p>The most popular brands of water heaters are reliable, affordable, have good value and are always available. While tankless water heaters run more efficiently than storage tank water heaters, replacing a tank water heater with a tankless can be expensive, and the payback time can be longer than the warranty.
