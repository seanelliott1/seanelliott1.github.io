<h2>Water Heater Services Independence Kentucky</h2>
<p>Not many of us know a whole lot about water heaters or water heater repair. Electric heaters are often cheaper to purchase and the spare parts needed for repairs are usually easy to find and cheap to buy. Water heaters are one of the unsung heroes of the plumbing world. By no means does this list include everything that is and should be checked on a water heating system but, hopefully, it will help you to know more about your system than you knew before and protect you from harm. ENERGY STAR certified models are available for water heater tanks.</p>
<p>When a homeowner is unhappy with a tankless water heater, it usually concerns the issues above, and managing expectations about how their tankless water heater should perform. Before you buy, note the stem length required by your water heater model. How they work: Tankless systems heat your water on demand using gas or electric coils. They are also insulated to keep the water hot between heating cycles. It's time to replace your unit.</p>
<p>Water heaters tend to go bad every seven to fifteen years, depending on the model and how they are maintained. Therefore, regardless of the efficiency rating of your tankless heater, if it is not a direct-vent model, your home will lose heat (and air conditioning) to any tankless model that uses room air for combustion. The biggest benefit of a tankless water heater is that it never runs out of hot water.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Installation Independence</h3>
<p>The optimal size of a water heater is based on the number of occupants in the house and the peak water demand. This means that tankless water heaters don't produce the same standby energy losses that traditional units do while they keep standing water warm and ready for use, which can save you hundreds of dollars on your energy bills. Rarely, both elements will test OK, but you're still not getting hot water.</p>
<p>The cost difference between a traditional water heater and a tankless water heater usually shows the tankless option for a whole house water heater being 2 to 3 times more expensive. Our water heater team offers all water heater services, including 24-hour emergency repairs and replacements. Defective water can heaters consume a lot of gas and electricity, so you'll save quite a bit of cash by upgrading to an Energy Star-qualified model.</p>
<p>January and November also seem to be good months to buy a water heater. Attach a new temperature and pressure relief valve to the heater. The electric tankless unit will only heat the water that you use and does not have the standby heat loss that typically comes with traditional tank-type products. If our water heater inspection determines that your unit has outlived its useful life or is damaged beyond economical repair, we may suggest a full water heater replacement.</p>
<p>Doctor Water Heater provides emergency house calls and delivers high quality water heaters. You should think first of the safety of your family, so when you have water heater installed in your house it is very important to check it regularly. The average tankless unit is around 27 inches tall, 18 inches wide, 10 inches deep, and rectangular. The average cost to replace a water heater is $850, with most homeowners spending between $780 and $965.</p>
<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Independence KY</h3>
<p>Stop suffering from common water heater issues and get help today by calling (408) 963-6896. The energy used to maintain a certain temperature when you are not using the water is often called standby heat loss. And because we don't have a storage tank we can choose a location where a tank-based unit may not fit - think small bathroom or even under sinks. We are knowledgeable local experts in both standard water heater repair and installation as well as tankless water heater installation and repair services.</p>
<p>Water Heater Inspection and Testing Make sure your water heater is working at optimum levels with our inspection and testing services. Because of this, they have proven to be more energy efficient compared to traditional tank units. Heads up, though, most plumbers will charge a diagnostic fee” (also called a trip charge” or service charge”), which covers the cost to come to your home, inspect and diagnose the unit (but doesn't include the cost of the actual repair).</p>
<p>Electric fired tankless heaters consume 50% less energy. To serve as a booster, eliminating long pipe runs, for solar water heating systems, dishwashers and sanitation. It is so compact it fits right under the vanity and will supply endless hot water to both sinks. Tankless water heaters cost up to three times more than storage heaters — from less than $1,000 for an electric, whole-house model to $3,000 for a gas-powered one, including installation by a qualified plumber.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Independence Kentucky 41051</h3>
<p>Whether you need a new water heater installation or some help with maintenance, you can trust our plumbing experts to help keep your home and family comfortable. Besides energy and cost savings, there are several other reasons to choose a tankless water heater over a traditional tank-style heater. Tankless units are complicated. Gas hot water not working is unusual, as gas hot water systems tend to be very reliable.</p>
<p>This means hooking up water lines and, for gas units, tying in the gas line and a ventilation system to remove exhaust fumes produced by burning gas for heating. Depending on the number of people in your home and your daily hot water needs, a water heater that once provided sufficient hot water may have trouble keeping up with your current demands, especially if they have changed. Enjoy your new water heater and the satisfaction you have in doing it yourself.</p>
<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>If it's your water heater, a repair isn't an option. Tankless water heater installation costs may be less than you think. The main disadvantage of tankless water heaters is their upfront cost (unit and installation) is significantly higher than tank-style heaters. We have seen our fair share of bad thermostats, heating elements, and check valves. You can change a thermocouple on most water heaters with only a small adjustable wrench.</p>
<p>Not all water heaters can be repaired. The great news is that there are only a few things that can go wrong with water heaters because they have only a few parts. So that increases the installation cost even further. If you flush your tank heater annually and call for professional service when you experience any operational issues, you will ensure your heater the maximum lifespan. High Energy Bills: Your water heater, particularly if you have a traditional tanked unit, is one of the highest consumers of electricity.</p>
