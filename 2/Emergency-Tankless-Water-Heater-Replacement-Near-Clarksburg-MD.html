<p>Water Heater Inspection and Testing Make sure your water heater is working at optimum levels with our inspection and testing services. Because of this, they have proven to be more energy efficient compared to traditional tank units. Heads up, though, most plumbers will charge a diagnostic fee” (also called a trip charge” or service charge”), which covers the cost to come to your home, inspect and diagnose the unit (but doesn't include the cost of the actual repair).</p>

This will leave you with one less bill to worry about. As these heating systems are tankless, your risk of flooding is diminished.</p>
<p>If electric you will probably need 220 volt service run to the location where the unit will be installed, which can also be some what expensive. If you have a gas water heater and you smell gas inside the premises, it is an emergency situation, you need to call water heaters repair services urgently.

<p>Once your plumber arrives, he or she will talk with you about what has been going on with your water heater. There will be either a lever or knob on one of the water pipes coming out of the wall to the water heater. Use dielectric fittings when connecting copper pipe to steel water heater connections. As long as your unit is the right capacity for the number of people in your home, that should mean no one ever has to settle for cold or lukewarm water again.</p>
