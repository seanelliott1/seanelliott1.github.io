They may require a mechanical permit, gas piping permit and electrical permit depending on the local jurisdiction and what was required to install the new appliance.</p>

<p>Beehive Plumbing is happy to come out and work on any hot water heater problems you may be having. With the blossoming market of energy-saving technology ever expanding, upgrading your water heater could easily save you money on your monthly bills while improving the efficiency of your hot water system.

Storage tank water heaters last an average of 10-15 years, while tankless water heaters may last 20 years or more before suffering in performance due to age. While most homes will have traditional tanked units, tankless water heater systems are quickly gaining popularity, and for good reason. Compared to the 7.5 to 9.5 gallons per minute that storage tanks can pump out, tankless units average flow rates between 2.5 and 5 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>If your water heater does not have a flue, then it is an electric water heater with a 240-volt supply (see the images in Figure 1 ).

If the water heater liner corrodes, the unit can start leaking—and if the drain pan under the water heater is old or incorrectly installed, you may end up with water damage to your floors, ceilings or wall, depending on the location of your appliance.</p>
<p>Tankless water heater works rather differently from the conventional water heating system - it does not require a tank for hot water storage and it is more environment friendly as the system avoids standby energy consumption. Meeting increased hot water demands can be a challenge for traditional tank-style heaters. No matter the type, brand, or age of your water heater, our team can repair and maintain it. Our local technicians are licensed for gas, electric, and tankless water heater repair.</p>
