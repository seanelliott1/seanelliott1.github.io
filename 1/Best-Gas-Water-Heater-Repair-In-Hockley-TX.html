If you're fortunate enough to live someplace sunny most of the year around, a solar powered water heater may be an option for you.

<p>Older water heaters that use a tank can be quite large and take up a lot of space. The colder the incoming water the more heat the heater has to create. This can put a lot of strain on an average system, in such cases it could be wise to install more than one heater. The breakdown of your hot water heater can be from both preventable and unpreventable causes, such as a buildup of mineral scale, a disconnected gas or power supply, a problem with the temperature pressure release valve, and vent obstructions.</p>

The main difference between electric and gas water heaters is the heat source. Once power and water supply issues are addressed, a tankless water heater is fairly straightforward to install and is certainly much easier to maneuver into place.</p>
<p>Households that use more hot water, in any climate, may also find that when they ask are tankless water heaters worth it the answer is yes and no. This is because they will be using so much hot water that their heater is working just as much whether it is a tankless or a conventional.
