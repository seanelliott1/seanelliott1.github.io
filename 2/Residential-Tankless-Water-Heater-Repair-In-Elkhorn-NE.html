<p>Most homeowners have conventional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored. Replacement of the anode rod: To prevent water from corroding the inside of the tank, a water heater includes a sacrificial” anode rod—a long piece of metal that the water eats away at instead of the tank walls. Another problem is that once this set amount of water runs out you have to wait until the tank reheats more water.</p>
<p>While conventional tanks can last for 10 to 12 years, tankless water heaters typically last for 20 years or more. Most tank heaters are expected to last 8-10 years.

Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem. These steps may have a more immediate effect upon your energy usage than installing a tankless water heater will.</p>

Age: As a rule, if your water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to invest in a new water heater. As soon you turn off the water flow, the heater turns off.
