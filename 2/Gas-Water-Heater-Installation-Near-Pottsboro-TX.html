<p>Perhaps the most common and easiest way to heat water is by the use of a gas hot water heater, and this might be due to the fact that gas is capable of getting the tank up to operating temperature roughly twice as quickly as its electric counterpart, and the cost is also approximately half as much as electricity would cost. Tank water heaters are great and very reliable, but if you are looking for a more energy-efficient that can save you a lot of money, tankless water heaters are the way to go.
