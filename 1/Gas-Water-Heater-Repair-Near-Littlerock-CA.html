As mentioned, installing a new water heater of any type requires expertise in electrical, gas, and plumbing. Colder incoming groundwater temperature will limit the product options to the higher kW units, which require a larger electrical service and breaker size capacity.</p>

In a gas powered setup the components include an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, a gas control valve and a thermocouple. Luckily we at Lascko Services have the expertise needed to provide you with the very best water heater service around. A water heater replacement in most cases can be installed and working perfectly within a just a few hours as well, excluding unexpected complications.</p>

Once repaired, you may want to consider a maintenance plan on your hot water heater to make sure that you do not have future issues. Because of the demands of larger households, it might make sense to install one or more additional tankless units. The computer pulls in gas and ignites a fire within the contained burner, which provides heat to the heat exchanger The incoming water is then circulated through the activated heat exchanger, heating the water to the temperature set on the thermostat before leaving the system through the hot water outlet pipe where it is directed to the appropriate faucet or appliance.</p>
