While far from difficult, installing an electric water heater does involve plumbing and electrical work, which may be enough to put off quite a few people. Units that support recirculation deliver instant hot water more efficiently. When you notice a noise, shut the water heater and call for professional help.</p>
<p>The new line of A. Smith electric tankless water heaters provide an energy efficient and easy-to-install solution for your home or business. Whether you have an electric or gas water heater, it needs something to cycle the heat on and off. This means that water heaters should be set above 115 degrees in order to prevent the build-up of the bacteria in the system. If your current water heater is old, it's likely a conventional tank water heater.</p>

Water heaters are one of the most important components of your plumbing system. No energy is wasted keeping water hot that may not be needed for several hours.

<p>The majority of people don't have their water heater stored in a conspicuous place so the color is of lesser importance and the appearance is not relevant either. On the other hand, tankless heater works in better efficient as water is heated on demand. If a heater isn't equipped with a built-in neutralizing cartridge, the installer has to add one. However, you should consider your usage preferences, energy supply, and space considerations when talking with your local water heater service provider.</p>
<p>An electric water heater will occasionally pose the same problems as a conventional water heater, such as leaks and mineral buildup, but with the addition of an electrical system. Rumbling, popping or banging noise from inside the water heater. Codes require a subpanel (which may be supplied along with the unit) to be installed next to the unit. The electric heaters on the other hand can last from ten to fifteen years.</p>
<p>Even if a larger heater is available, there is always a size and weight consideration in an RV. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy. Through increased efficiency and regular maintenance and repairs tankless water heaters can positively impact your energy bills.</p>

<p>Because a tankless unit is only on” when you open your faucet for hot water, it works significantly less than a traditional tank would and as a result the gears and mechanisms inside the unit wear out and break down much less faster. That's because thermal energy—or heat—is constantly escaping through the sides and bottom of the tank, and that's also why the tank is warm to the touch. Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
