<p>There's never a good time to run out of hot water—especially if you're halfway through a shower. Single point heaters cost around $150 each and are suitable for areas with smaller capacity demands such as bathroom showers, and they are generally electrically powered. As a rule of thumb, water heaters are not designed to last much beyond about 10 to 15 years (more or less). The "largest" electric tankless heaters can't match the output of a "standard" gas tankless unit.</p>

The average energy savings and additional lifespan make tankless heaters a viable option for many homes. Generally as your heater ages sediment build-up will occur, decreasing the amount of hot water that the heater can produce.</p>
<p>As the water flows over the coils it is properly heated so you never have to wait for it to get to the right temperature when it reaches the outlet. If using a single point unit, you want the unit fairly close to where the hot water will be used in order to deliver the water in a timely way.
