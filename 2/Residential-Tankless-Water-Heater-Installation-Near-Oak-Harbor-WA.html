<h2>Water Heater Services Oak Harbor Washington</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>Our professional technicians have the experience and know-how to get even the toughest of heating and air repairs done with imperative results.

<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Oak Harbor WA</h3>
<p>The most obvious drawback to a tankless water heater is the higher cost for both the unit and the installation. When sediment has built up inside your tank or the heating element stops working, we might be able to repair it. Elements can corrode due to a higher mineral content in the water such as you typically find with well water. Tankless water heating technology checks all the boxes to a more comfortable home.</p>
<p>In normal conditions, the anode slowly corrodes away to protect the water heater against rust. Remember, tankless water heaters don't keep a supply of hot water ready to flow immediately when you need it. We provide a full range of repair services for tankless water heaters. It has a holding tank like a conventional water heater, but sitting atop the tank is a heat pump that captures warm air and transmits it to the water—sort of like a refrigerator working in reverse.</p>

A gas heater has a burner underneath the tank while electric heaters have an element in the tank to heat the water. We offer same day service and convenient appointments so you never have to wait around when you're in need, and we provide all our plumbers with fully stocked trucks so they can take care of repairs on the first trip.</p>
