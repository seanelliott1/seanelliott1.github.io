All costs are for the unit only, this does not include installation, transportation or additional costs. A tankless water heater typically relies on an in-line filter to prevent sediment and other solids from entering and clogging the heat exchanger. Price with installation: Varies dramatically depending on the type, brand, your home, and whether you are installing a new heater or replacing an old one.</p>
