<h2>Water Heater Services Florence Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The useful life of a water heater is around twelve years, so sooner or later all it will need to be replaced. Tankless water heaters work differently than a standard hot water tank. There are a number of commercially available that provide both space heating and hot water. In the case of electric, the water is usually heated up by an electric heating element, while a gas heater uses a gas burner to heat up the water. If the water heater is not lit, you can light it if you are familiar with the process or contact the gas company or a plumbing professional for help with igniting it. If the pilot is indeed off, turn off the gas valve immediately and ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.</p>
<p>Your contractor does not require any special training or previous experience with tankless water heaters. Installing a tankless water heater is a greater upfront investment, but these units can significantly cut the cost of monthly utilities. We perform all types of hot water heater repair services, from routine tank flushes and heating element replacement to leaking pipes. The traditional storage tank hot water heaters are generally going to provide most people the gallons per minute of water they desire.</p>
<p>This replaces the endless heating and cooling of gallons of water that a conventional tank water heater does throughout the day, which saves you from high energy costs and needing to limit how many people can shower at one time. For this reason, tankless systems are also called on-demand water heaters. At Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc.

<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair Florence</h3>
<p>Sizing an everyday tank water heater can be easier than a tankless water heater. Now, you might be thinking: A recirculation pump in combination with a tankless water heater would cause a huge waste of energy due to frequent pumping and re-heating.” And you were right, if you wouldn't make use of some type of smart control. To avoid this problem, a larger unit can be installed. So they may not be able to fit into spaces where an old heater of the same capacity could go. Tankless gas heaters are about the size of a suitcase and hang on the wall.</p>
<p>If you have ever done those things you might have found out that the T&P Valve wouldn't close properly after checking it and the water heater drain valve now leaks. We also install tankless systems. We will come in and replace any old piping, fix you up with corrosion-free drain plugs, and install the most energy-efficient models built today. Install the various fittings that come with the water heater. Estimate how much hot water your household uses during peak hours and look for a heater with a first hour rating (FHR) that meets your demand.</p>
<p>Tank-type water heaters store hot water so that it's available when needed. Whether you'd like an electric water heater, gas water heater, or an energy-efficient tankless water heater, our skilled plumbers can help with the selection and installation. Switch off the gas valve and turn off the electric supply to the heater at the circuit breaker — watch the pilot light go out to ensure no more gas remains.</p>
<p>Installation is easier and less expensive, and they're generally not as difficult to maintain as gas models. Occasionally, some water heaters require parts specific to the brand and model of that water heater and we will need to order parts from the manufacturer, after a diagnosis is complete. Connect the water piping to new heater using the shark bite fittings or whatever fittings you decided on. You may have to solder the new dielectrics to the water piping if you have copper pipe.</p>
<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Florence MA</h3>
<p>Since there is no tank to fill and refill, tankless water heaters give you an endless supply of hot water, so it doesn't matter how many people are using it at any given time. On-Demand Tankless Hot Water Heaters have been gaining popularity as home and business owners have become more concerned with energy costs. Once the gas and water are off, and the water heater is drained, you can rest easy that the you will not have to deal with untold amounts of damage and concentrate on repairing or replacing the water heater.</p>
<p>The first thing to check is for any leaks or standing water near your water heater. If the pilot light is out, follow the instructions posted on the water heater or the details below here to relight the pilot light. Reconnect the wire that was removed from the heating element to perform the resistance check in the previous steps. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating costs.</p>
<p>By installing it as a point of use water heater, you will get instant hot water as soon as you turn on the faucet. Generally, gas powered tankless water heaters heat water up at a slightly higher rate compared to electric powered ones. Alternatively, in an electric setup there is only a water storage tank, two heating elements and a thermostat control. They came right on time, discussed the options and proceeded to repair our water heater for far less than a new one.</p>
