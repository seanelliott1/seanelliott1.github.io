A common misconception is that a water heater which has stopped functioning has to be replaced. With these units, you don't have to ever worry about a rusted tank that leaks. The power source for a tankless water heater needs to be readily accessible in the area where the tank is installed.

Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller. Consumer Reports recently tested four electric and five gas whole-house tankless water heaters from such brands as Bosch, Navien, Noritz, Rheem, Rinnai, Tempra, and Trutankless to see how costs, performance, and energy use stack up against that of conventional storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Depending on your tankless water heater's capacity, too many simultaneous hot water applications (such as multiple showers running) can overload your water heater. Yes, one of the main reasons we get called out to a customer's house is their water heater has broken down and isn't supplying hot water anymore. This isn't an issue with tankless water heaters. Solar, tankless systems and fuel oil systems, however, can cost as much as $1,000 or more to install.</p>
