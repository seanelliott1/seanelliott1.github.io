<p>Although it rarely happens, explosions are a serious risk with tank-style water heaters. A gas-powered tankless system has to use burners just like a tank system. However, they're also more costly to install and may struggle to provide hot water to multiple fixtures or appliances simultaneously. Tank water heaters are a common type of water heater. While they can be much more expensive than traditional units, tankless water heaters do deliver big long-term savings.</p>

<p>But, optimizing the location relative to the plumbing fixtures in your home or business will also reduce your energy bill and water consumption. In fact, your home's gas piping, gas meter and gas line to the meter may not be sized appropriately to handle the high gas load that will be replacing the conventional storage gas water heater. The next indication that you can use to determine you need a new water heater is that there is an actual leak on the tank itself.</p>

A Traditional water heater stores and preheats 30-50 gallons of water in a tank.

<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Fullerton CA</h3>
<p>For homes that use 41 gallons of water or less, tankless water heaters can be 24% to 34% more energy efficient. The tankless water heater usually heats water directly without requiring the use of a storage tank. These types of heaters have a lot of mechanical parts and need a professional to troubleshoot. Most property owners don't think about replacing water heaters until it's a need. For example, many homes, regardless of the type of fuel source used to heat hot water tanks now require a 4” exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>In addition to providing expert tankless water heater repairs, we also specialize in installations and replacements. Other materials, including heat pumps and pipes, are not included in standard installation costs. In locations where water has a high mineral content, otherwise known as hard water, add a water softener to reduce the unwanted effects that those mineral deposits can have on the water heater tank.</p>
<p>Who should buy a tank water heater: If you have a timeline or budget constraints that prevent you from getting a tankless system, a tank heater may be the way to go. If your home runs strictly on electricity, you have to carefully consider whether going tankless is really worth it. The average household capacity is around 200 amps, which may not be enough to support a tankless electric heater. Tankless hot water heaters are available in propane (LP), natural gas, or electric models.</p>

<p>It's important to keep a separate store of water on hand just in case the public water pipes are damaged, broken or if your public water supply becomes contaminated. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. Instant water heaters have a lifespan of 15 to 18 years. There are numerous benefits to investing in professional water heater maintenance in Des Moines.</p>
<p>Plumbing by Jake offers fast repairs and installations backed by a guarantee. Leave it to Stroop's to bring you the best in tankless water heating. To prevent serious health issues from interior air contamination, gas-powered tankless water heaters require special venting to remove the hot carbon monoxide exhaust fumes and expel them to the outside air. It's usually placed in your basement, by furnace or water heater, or underneath your kitchen sink.</p>
<p>So, if your current tank is larger than 55 gallons you will need to think about a new solution before it is time to replace your hot water heater. When using a conventional water heater, rust and scale build-up can collect in the interior of the storage tank. A power vent tankless water heater will function best when it is installed in an area with adequate airflow around it for combustion to take place.

<p>Before you opt for a tankless unit, however, learn the pros, cons and installation considerations that come with these modern money-savers. In fact, they will cost a lot up front, and will then be hard to install the first time. The idea of installing a Tankless Water Heater has a ton of appeal to homeowners. Here are a few of our most frequently asked questions about gas water heaters and electric water heater systems.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters never run out of hot water, putting an end to organizing cooking, laundry, and showering around how much hot water is in the tank. Installing a tankless water heater is NOT a DIY job. It is not necessary to wrap Teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element(s) unless the new element specifies the use of it (especially if the replacement element has a gasket). We offer service in traditional gas and electric water heaters.</p>
