Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
