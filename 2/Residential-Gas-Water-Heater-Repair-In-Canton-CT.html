<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Canton</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are still unusual in the U.S., where tank-type water heaters have been used for many years. Although a second unit might seem like a large investment, it can actually save you money in the long run since you'll use less water while waiting for hot water to arrive and less gas to heat the water. A tankless gas water heater needs a gas line to the water heater, and the unit must be vented to the outside.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking for a water heating system for your new home or your current system has seen better days and needs a replacement, one of the first things you need to do is to look at all of your available options and weigh their pros and cons. How many GPM a tankless heater can deliver is entirely dependent on how much energy (either electric or gas) the unit has available to heat the water. These types of water heaters are able to last 20 years, whereas tank water heaters last 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>Gas-powered water heaters must vent out combustion fumes safely from the system. Unlike a storage tank water heater, which loses heat from the tank continually and must keep using energy to heat it up again, a tankless system only works when needed. After determining your fuel source, the next step is to decide if you are going to heat your water with electricity or natural gas. Your Assured Comfort plumbing experts will thoroughly examine your water heater, and explain the issue and your repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>Consequently, the exhaust vent can be PVC or polypropylene and not metal, a feature that can lower the cost of installation. Our trained and certified plumbers will provide you with an honest, upfront price on the cost to install a tankless water heater ($29 or FREE if you choose us to install your water heater). For safety reasons, the water heater should not be on air conditioning lines or under pipes that can drip.</p>
<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Canton CT</h3>
<p>With a tankless system, you have unlimited hot water since the water is being heated on the fly and not from a stored container. With a tankless water heater, San Diego residents can enjoy up to a 40 percent energy savings on their SDG&E bill compared to a traditional model. The tankless system avoids this and provides you with peace-of-mind knowing that you don't have a potential hydro-time-bomb in your utility closet.</p>
<p>Turn Off On Its Own: If there issues within the tankless water heater than it can cause it to turn off on its own. Many of today's tankless water heater models are wi-fi compatible and can be monitored with a smart phone. In most cases, the water heater always gives way to the furnace thereby depriving you of hot water supply. A cracked or corroded storage tank is also a sign you need to replace your entire unit.</p>

<p>Compact tankless water heaters only heat water when you need it. This type of heater uses gas burners or electric coils to heat water on demand. Plus you need a wye, not a T where the water heater and furnace connect. These units provide on demand” performance since they don't have a storage tank. Nevertheless, it's something just about everyone must deal with at some point or another because no water heating system lasts forever.</p>
<p>Installing a tankless hot water heater can be pricy. Fortunately, it can be easily remedied with a simple call to the experts at Valley Air Heating, Cooling & Plumbing. Identical water heaters don't always perform as well. In colder climates like ours with colder groundwater, smaller tankless water heaters will only deliver enough hot water for one shower at a time. Moreover, much of the heat produced by the pilot light of a tank-type model heats the water in the tank, heat that is just lost with the instantaneous units.</p>
<p>Some of the common geyser repairs that we encounter and fix are overheating of water, water not heating enough or not heating at all, rust colored water, automatic heating function not working, water dripping from geyser (leakage), etc. To install the water heater in its place, start by pre-screwing the 4 bolts from your fixing kit into the rods. This is not covered in the video, but you should always check that the water heater is not receiving any electricity after shutting it off at the circuit breaker.</p>

<p>Gas versions use a gas burner to heat up the water as it passed through the pipe, while an electric type uses a heating element. He decides to remove and replace his failing water heater with a tankless water heater, and walks us through the process. Beyond the initial cost, the national average for the installation of a tankless unit is slightly over $1,700. A problem one contractor might solve with an inexpensive replacement of a sacrificial anode could inspire another, less scrupulous contractor to solve by recommending a brand new (and expensive) water heater.</p>
