<h2>Water Heater Services Darby Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>When you talk about a gas tankless water heater, very few people know the work involved in installing one. Rather than storing water, tankless water heaters use heating coils to heat the water as you need it. They're more energy-efficient than a storage tank but provide only a limited flow of hot water per minute—about 3.5 gallons, depending on inlet water temperatures. A house in a warmer climate will require a tankless system with a lower gallons-per-minute rating than a home in a more northern state because it doesn't take as much energy or BTUs to heat the water in a southern climate.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters are more energy and space efficient, have a longer lifespan and perform better than conventional water heaters, but most homes are still equipped with conventional heaters, whose average life span is ten to fifteen years. Tankless water heaters offer a proven alternative to the storage tank water heaters most commonly found in US homes. The job of the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is to release excessive pressure from steam buildup, but the TP valve may have been improperly installed, or it may be faulty.</p>
<p>If your building inspector finds a non-direct vent heater installed in a confined space, you will probably be told to add 2 new penetrations through the wall (known as high-and-low venting) or you will be told to remove it until it conforms to the code requirements. Heating water amounts to nearly 20% of a home's energy costs, so making sure you have a reliable water heater helps you save energy and money.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a tank heater only lasts about 10-12 years before having to be replaced, mostly because of corrosion inside the tank. Both these models are tankless and use natural gas, although you can also find models that use propane gas. Gas tankless water heaters are more expensive to install. Unlike the traditional tank water heater which is selected based on the capacity of the tank inside it, a tankless water heater will be chosen on its ability to service the demand during peak usage times throughout the day.</p>
<p>The test used an inlet temperature of 58° F for gas models and 74° F for electrics (plus or minus 2° F) and a target outlet temperature of 120° F. Water travels in pipes through solar collectors (typically installed on your roof), where it is heated by the sun. Turn on the cold water supply valve to the water heater and turn on the water supply valve (or the house water supply, as applicable). Traditional storage water tank heaters, also known as "boilers" are the most common water heaters installed for the last 120 years or so and are used for central heating and can also heat the water for your home using steam.</p>
