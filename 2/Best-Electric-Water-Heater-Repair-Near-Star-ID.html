One of the downsides of apartment living is that you're not necessarily in control of your own water heater.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>With tankless water heaters, there is no tank to store water, so you'll always experience fresh and clean hot water because the unit heats water on demand as it passes through the unit. All these noises are an indication that the water heater system is working too hard, and it can cause damage to the interior of your tank. Water heater is over ten years old.

Whether you're running out of hot water on a daily basis, struggling with high energy costs, or worried about deterioration, you may be looking for a change.

<p>Over time, water heaters wear out. Since storage tank types have a shorter useful life (about ½ the life of on-demand water heaters), typically 10 to 15 years, you may need to buy and install them almost twice as often as tankless water heaters, reducing your purchase savings. Traditional gas water heaters have an EF between 0.50 and 0.60. High-efficiency models have an EF of 0.82. The higher the EF, the more efficient the water heater.</p>
