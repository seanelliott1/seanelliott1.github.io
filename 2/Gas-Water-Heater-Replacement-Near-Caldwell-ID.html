<p>The answer to who invented the electric water heater begins around 1850 with an experiment that was created in which both water and bath, on the underneath side, were heated by gas jets. The best water heating solution for your home is one that provides the hot water you need at the lowest cost; as your current water heater ages, it will only continue to lose efficiency through wear and tear and hot water prices will rise, as opposed to new hot water heater installation, which offers you all the benefits of a new water heater and the technological advancements in efficiency that have been made since your current water heating system was installed.</p>

<p>Most DIYers try to make their own water heater repairs in an effort to save money. A tankless water heater installation really isn't all that complicated and there aren't too many parts that have to be purchased. Gas is more energy efficient and cheaper to run, but electric will not make a drastic difference. Tankless Water Heaters have become a really hot commodity in the last couple of years (I know, that was a really bad pun).</p>
<p>With a tankless, you also won't have the breakdown issue with water on the floor,” he says. We offer emergency and routine Geyser and heater repair to the residents of area and commercials area. It protects your water heater tank from rusting through electrolysis, which lets the rod corrode instead of the steel in the water heater.

<p>Enjoy more hot water for less by replacing your water heater with a more reliable, energy-efficient Rheem unit. Improved Energy Efficiency: On average, tankless water heaters use 30 to 50% less energy, so you can start enjoying the cost savings of lower energy bills. So long as this pipe is in good condition, you will use it to connect to your new water tank. Next, shut off the water supply to the water heater.</p>
<p>When deciding on an installation location for your tankless water heater, you may have more options than if you are switching from a boiler. A condensing unit employs a second heat exchanger which uses exhaust from the first to further heat the water - a much more efficient design. If your heating and air conditioning system is the most important appliance in your home, then your water heater is a close second.</p>
<p>A tankless water heater can place a virtually unlimited supply of hot water within your reach 24 hours a day while saving you time, energy, money, and space. First of all, it is important to understand the basic operation of a tankless water heater. New storage tank water heaters are required to operate more efficiently, and tankless (on-demand) water heaters are even more efficient than that. This indicates what sort of energy source is used to heat the water.</p>
<p>A conventional heater heats the water in a storage tank to a specific temperature, typically about 120° Fahrenheit, and keeps it there. If there is adequate electrical service and room in the breaker panel, electric tankless is a great option. The heating element in the unit heats it up to the temperature that is desired. Your water heater is now about twelve years old and you are positive that your water heater is living on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Once you have placed the new water heater in the compartment, installed your hot and cold connections, connected your gas supply line, and connected the pressure relief line, you are ready to fill the tank. Your water heater works silently around the clock to give you a constant supply of warm water. Look out for the energy factor (EF) too, as this indicates how well the unit can converts its fuel to heat. Water quality is an important consideration for all water equipment, and water heaters will often be impacted the most.</p>
