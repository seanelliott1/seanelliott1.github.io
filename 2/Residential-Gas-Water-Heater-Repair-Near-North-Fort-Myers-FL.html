<h2>Water Heater Services North Fort Myers Florida</h2>
<p>Not many of us know a whole lot about water heaters or water heater repair. Electric heaters are often cheaper to purchase and the spare parts needed for repairs are usually easy to find and cheap to buy. Water heaters are one of the unsung heroes of the plumbing world. By no means does this list include everything that is and should be checked on a water heating system but, hopefully, it will help you to know more about your system than you knew before and protect you from harm. ENERGY STAR certified models are available for water heater tanks.</p>
<p>These are not required for gas instant hot water systems. Electric water heaters are high-voltage (240-volt) appliances that are dangerous to work with when the power is on. Before checking any electrical parts of a water heater, shut off the power to the heater's circuit by turning off the appropriate breaker in your home's service panel (breaker box). Water damage from an old tank water heater happens a lot and is often expensive to restore.</p>
<p>The voltage of most heaters range between 110V to 277V. This could happen at the top or bottom of the water heater, where the pipes come out. However, if your water looks rusty, has a funky smell, or produces a strange noise, it's time to call a professional for a hot water heater repair. The mobile home water heater never gets looked at till it breaks down, but just like your central heating boiler ay home, it should be serviced annually.</p>
