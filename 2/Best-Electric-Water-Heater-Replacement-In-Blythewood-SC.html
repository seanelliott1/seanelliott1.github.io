<h2>Water Heater Services Blythewood South Carolina</h2>
<p>Water Heaters are a necessary household appliance that supplies all of your warm water needs, from cooking to bathing. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often. We also want enough hot water for our needs and energy costs savings. Many people don't know much about water heaters or water heater repairs. A well-maintained tankless water heater can last for a long time. Typical anticipated lifetimes for these water heaters are 8-12 years for conventional and 10-15 years for high-efficiency.</p>
<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>

<p>Many people are going towards getting tankless water heat so that they do not need to keep it maintained of another appliance. Energy Efficient - The tankless system only consumes either gas or electricity when someone needs hot water, using about 35% less energy than a tank water heater.

<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Blythewood SC</h3>
<p>A 50 gallon water heater can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours for electric or 30 to 60 minutes for gas to heat water to 120 degrees. It really depends on the brand you buy, and the cost of the model purchased, but a traditional water heater will last 10 to 13 years, and a tankless water heater will generally last up to 20 years. If the circuit breaker or fuse repeatedly blows out, call a qualified electrician to check and repair the circuit.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>The most efficient storage tank has an energy factor of about67, but according to Energy Star, some tankless units have energy factors as high as95. Whole-home water heating systems may cost a little more upfront than a tank-style heater, but over time these systems usually pay for themselves time and time again. We'll also test for rust and do everything we can to keep your water heater running well so you can always have the hot water you need.</p>
<h3>Water Tank Repair Blythewood South Carolina 29016</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest disadvantage of traditional tank models is that you're limited by the amount of hot water the tank will hold. Here is where the tankless water heater comes in to play. The first thing homeowners want to check is whether there is water leaking from their hot water heater; and if it is a gas hot water heater, whether the pilot is lit. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand. Unheated water enters one side of the tank.</p>
<p>The further your water has to travel from the water heater to its destination, the more noticeable the gap. He will also show you the easy way to carry a water heater out of your home, even if you are working alone. Tankless water heaters can be installed on walls, in garages, or outdoors using an anti-freeze kit. Also, as I mentioned earlier, tank-style heaters break down over time due to hard water causing the inner lining of the tank to rust and corrode.</p>
<p>Instead, the water is heated when it passes through the system, which may be fuelled by gas or electricity. Typical home water heaters are the large storage types that take up a significant amount of room in the garage or basement. After a while fixing a leak-prone water heater can become costly. Our plumbers know that this can be stressful, but we are here to offer quick and effective water heater replacement service for your home or business.</p>

Keep in mind, however, that as a trusted water heater contractor, our most important goal when working on your project is to do it correctly, instead of quickly.</p>
