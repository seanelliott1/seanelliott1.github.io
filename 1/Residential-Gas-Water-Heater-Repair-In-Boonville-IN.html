Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>Gas units just heat water faster than electric, tankless or otherwise. A traditional water heater has an average lifespan of 10 to 15 years, but they can fail without warning.
