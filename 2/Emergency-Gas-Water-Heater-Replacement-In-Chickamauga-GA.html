<p>It is an option to install your own electric tankless water heater. This price estimate includes the cost of a basic tank water heater, installation, materials, removal of the old unit, and the cost of any permits.

<p>If you have been looking to cut on your energy bills, replacing your old water tank heater and upgrading to a tankless heater is the way to go. Traditional tanks are outdated in every sense of the word; they are bulky, slow, and unreliable in addition to facilitating energy wastage. Our plumbers can inspect and troubleshoot, and also offer maintenance services to help limit the risk of repair issues down the road.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>In such cases, our Thousand Oaks water heater repair professionals will explain to you why replacing your old water heater will be cheaper in the long run than repairing it time and time again. Our technicians have specialized training in tankless systems, which means we can address the areas of installation, repair, and replacement with equal confidence.
