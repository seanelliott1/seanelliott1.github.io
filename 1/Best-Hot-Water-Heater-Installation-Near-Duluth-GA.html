<p>Once again, this depends on the gas water heater installation distances from the water and gas supply, as well as any required electrical work. The age is also going to be affected by how much this water heater is used, as more wear and tear can cause the product to age faster. Old hot water heaters have parts that are worn. Tanked hot water heaters tend to last an average of 10-12 years, while their warranties tend to expire after 6 years or so. Tank-type water heaters also require periodic maintenance, otherwise they can and will fail before their anticipated lifespan.</p>
<p>In short, the answer depends on what brand and type of tankless water heater you buy. These are the arguments for investing in a tankless water heater. Instead of a storage tank, a tankless heater has a coiled chamber in it that works similar to the radiator in your car. For our California customers we will also properly earthquake strap and brace the water heater as required by the California state code for earthquake safety.</p>

Since tankless water heaters need a minimum amount of water flow before activating, there's a gap between completely cold water and the coolest warm water that you can create with a hot and cold water mix.</p>
<p>Check the main switch on the water heater and the circuit breaker (or fuse) that serves the water heater. A tankless water heater is more expensive than its traditional counterpart. The only problem I found with it, which I later discovered that it is common to all brands of this water heaters is that the installation can be expensive, since you may need upgrades to pipes and additional electrical work. In addition, water in a tank has to be heated hotter than necessary to account for these stand-by losses.</p>
<p>Traditional tanked storage water heaters are the most commonly found type of water heaters in homes today.

Michael Bonsby's plumbers are trained and certified so you can ensure you are getting professional installation service every time. California requires that all water heaters, including tankless, meet the state's minimum efficiency standards.</p>
<p>In addition, you will benefit from adjusting your hot water temperature with the changing seasons to get the right temperature from the faucets. Manufacturers recommend that certified electricians or plumbers install tankless water heaters. Traditional electric hot water heater tanks take up as much as 16 square feet of floor space in your home, but a tankless water heater is very compact and can be fixed on almost any wall either inside or outside your home.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>

If your home uses a water heater, then don't compromise on the quality of your water heater installation and repair services. Rust and mineral buildup in the heat-exchanger will reduce the efficiency of the water heater and can block it totally.</p>

When problems arise with your home's hot water tank, you want a licensed plumber to always take care of the problem.

Our pros can help you decide on the right water heater to fit your needs. While this type of malfunction can be irksome, repairing or replacing a thermostat is one of the least invasive repair jobs that can crop up when it comes to water heater service. Tankless: You'll need to know the flow rate of each appliance, fuel source and the rise in temperature needed.</p>
<p>From time to time, repairs are required to meet some common problems like lukewarm water, a small flow, or a leak. With tankless water heaters, there's no storage hot water tank to leak or break, thus reducing the risk of flooding. Before making repairs or purchasing a new water heater, check the nameplate on the side of your current unit. Heating your water can use a lot of energy. If steam or excessively hot water shoots out of faucets, or you hear boiling sounds inside the water heater, the appliance may not be shutting off at its set temperature.</p>
