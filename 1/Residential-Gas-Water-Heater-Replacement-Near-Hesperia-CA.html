We provide a range of system types, brands, and sizes, including tank, tankless, hybrid, heat pump, and solar water heaters. With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>
<p>A concentric vent, which has an exhaust pipe inside a larger air-intake pipe, simplifies installation because only one hole needs to be cut in the wall. Turn on the water on the hot side at a tub spout and bleed all the air out of the water heater and water lines. A fully installed water heater can cost up to $5,000. Hard water (meaning it has a higher mineral content) in San Diego and surrounding areas causes a scale buildup that can damage heating elements.</p>
