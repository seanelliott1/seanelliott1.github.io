Since storage tank water heaters heat, then reheat water to pre-set temperature, irrespective of what your hot water needs happen to be, they increase your utility bills.</p>
<p>Maintenance: periodic water heater maintenance is recommended by the Department of Energy and will vary greatly based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but expect to pay standard hourly plumber fees of $45-$65 an hour for water heater maintenance, with most maintenance taking 1 to 2 hours for a yearly total of $45 to $130.
