<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Edwardsville IL</h3>
<p>Typically, you'll have a choice between gas, electric, tankless, and even solar-powered water heaters. Since the tank is the only part of the system that can actually force you to replace the water heater, be sure to troubleshoot before you buy a new unit. There is also a range of fuel sources that can heat water such as solar, gas, electricity and wood. Also known as instantaneous water heater, the heater heats the water on demand.</p>
<p>Determining whether you should repair your water heater or purchase a new one depends solely on what is wrong with it in the first place. They know from experience which models of heaters tend to hold up the best to the hard water. Therefore, the longer your traditional tank heater continues to rest in a utility closet or basement, the more likely you will be wasting electricity. Tankless systems heat water by activating a set of coils that become hot when the unit is turned on. As the water passes over the coils, it is heated, delivering hot water to you with little to no wait.</p>
<p>Typically tankless heaters do not have standing pilot lights like tank type units, saving even more energy. For example, the Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 measures about 14x36x5 inches and may be installed just about anywhere you will find proper electrical and plumbing connections.
