<h2>Water Heater Services Clear Lake Iowa</h2>

If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
<p>This is a type of heater that provides hot water only as it is needed. In order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water, the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat. Tankless gas models need to produce very high combustion temperatures so that they can instantaneously raise the temperature of incoming cold water to the desired temperature.</p>

<p>Longer lifespan: With a life expectancy of 20 years, tankless water heaters last 5-10 years longer than tank-type models. Tankless water heaters were first used in small apartments and other living spaces in Japan and Europe. A tankless water heater moves water from the hot water line through a heat exchanger, where heat from the gas jets is transferred into the water. Certain appliances, such as dishwashers or washing machines, can benefit from having their own tankless hot water system installed.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to figure out what's wrong with your hot water heater on your own, so instead, make an appointment with Timothy Off. We provide a range of system types, brands, and sizes, including tank, tankless, hybrid, heat pump, and solar water heaters. With a tank heater, the element is usually the first thing that goes out, usually well before the tank itself does. This reduces damage to the tank caused by overheating.</p>
<p>Because it's constantly heating and reheating water throughout the day. Heating your water can consume a lot of energy. Water heaters should be serviced regularly in order to preserve their functionality, and repairs may be necessary after substantial use or as the heater grows older, however, they simply don't last forever. Heaters can switch off if there is low water pressure, so the minimum flow rate specification is important here and it has limited capacity for heating.</p>
