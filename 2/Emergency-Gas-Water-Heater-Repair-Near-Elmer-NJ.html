<p>Hot water stops altogether: When our customers experience NO hot water, it's likely there's a broken heating element. A water heater that is leaking or that has dried water marks on or around it. Even dried marks indicate an occasional leak, which can mean there's a serious problem with your water heater. While a traditional water heater will work efficiently in your home for about 10-15 years, a tankless water heater will last up to five years longer than most other units.</p>
<p>Water heater type: Whole-home tankless units provide hot water to all plumbing fixtures in your home, while point-of-use (POU) units only provide hot water for a single appliance or area (like the kitchen or laundry room). The tankless heater is much smaller than a traditional tank water heater. Longer useful lives than storage tank water heaters. Many homeowners in Fort Wayne, IN are switching to a tankless water heater.</p>

<p>You are going to have to call around and ask for a "mobile home approved, sealed combustion" water heater. A functional water heater is nothing short of a blessing in winter. While the shape and sheer size of the appliance is arguably the biggest difference, tankless heaters have a number of other electronics and connections that need to be made correctly in order to work. Periodic cleaning and checkups are important to keep a tankless water heater in top condition.</p>
<p>Whatever your water heating needs, The Home Depot Canada has everything you need to get the job done right.

That means you will always get 120° water from your hot faucet when you turn it on, until the tank begins to replenish the tank from the cold water source.</p>
