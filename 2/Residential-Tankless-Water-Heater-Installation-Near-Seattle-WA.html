<h2>Water Heater Services Seattle Washington</h2>
<p>Water heaters can run into several problems if not maintained properly. We provide prompt, reliable repairs and service. Because of their high-powered burners, tankless heaters need to be installed in a well-vented space for safe operation. They repeatedly heat water so hot water is always ready. Water heaters are fired by gas or electricity. Water leaks and gas leaks can be fixed by tightening the connections or soldering the pipes. Tankless water heaters also have limited output. Whether you're looking for a quick repair or a comprehensive installation, Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters eliminate the long wait for heat of the traditional hot water tank. 3)The amount of water that the heater allows to flow through is regulated by the desired outlet temperature.

Although tankless water heaters heat water on demand, they do have output limits on their flow rate. Gas water heater system installation (hot water heater system replacement) requires a plumber who is also a licensed gas fitter for the hot water system installation. Tankless water heaters are a higher initial cost, but they will cost less to operate because they only need to heat water as it is required and use less energy.</p>
