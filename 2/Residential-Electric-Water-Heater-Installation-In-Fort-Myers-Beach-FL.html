<p>If you are looking for a new water heater, be aware that your options now reach far beyond replacing your current storage tank water heater with one just like it. As heating water typically consumes about 10 to 15 percent of a home's total monthly energy budget, all the best new water heaters focus on heating water efficiently. If you have hard water in your area, it is a good idea to install a long anodized rod in your water tank to absorb all of the particles that destroy the tanks and piping. Before any water heater installation, we will assess the requirements of your home and the size of your property, in order to determine which unit works best for you. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy says that by eliminating standby losses in a storage tank, a tankless system can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 15 percent.</p>

<p>Tankless water heaters are not a simple swap out.” Most conventional gas water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. No storage tank saves valuable space. The tankless heater compared to a conventional heater has unlimited hot water and can deliver for hours not limited by the tank's capacity. When you turn the hot water tap in a home with a tankless water heater, a powerful gas or electric heater kicks on and instantly heats water running through coils in the unit.</p>

<p>Whether we simply need to replace a broken part, remove excess sediment, repair the heating element, or do something else entirely, we'll make safety our priority. You waste more water because tankless heaters have to heat the water first since there isn't a tank full already waiting. Answers to this issue are turning up the heat dial on the water heater, insulating the hot water pipes, moving the water heater, installing a second water heater or adding a recirculating pump system.</p>
<p>When the water temperature falls below a preset level, the unit engages, and the water is reheated. This covers fuel type, tank size, energy efficiency and which models are within your budget. DIY water heater installations can be costly and ineffective. Sometimes however you may not have to replace the entire unit, but call a plumbing contractor for your water heater repair if the leak originates from the top.

<p>Whole-home tankless gas water heaters have specific flow rates that are relative to the necessary temperature rise. With new water heater efficiency standards, we now have the opportunity to have it all. Although gas and electric water heaters can lose some efficiency because water is constantly being heated in the tank, current efficiency standards are much improved over the past. Most water heaters are gas, so even the smallest of mistakes made during installation can cause added expenses, property damage, injury, or even death.</p>
<p>So in a larger unit with multiple residents—or several units sharing a water heater—it can be tricky to get enough hot water for everyone to shower at the same time, or to do laundry and run the dishwasher at the same time. They are also ideal for families who have small homes and little room for bulky water heaters. Continuous Supply of Hot Water: You never have to worry about running out of hot water, so this option is perfect for homeowners with family members who take long steamy showers.</p>
<p>If the tank is cold or very hot, it may be difficult to get the expected changes when dialing in different temperatures on the thermostat. Next, the water heater must be connected to a fuel source. Before removing your old water heater, we'll assess your property's specific needs and recommend the most cost-effective option.
