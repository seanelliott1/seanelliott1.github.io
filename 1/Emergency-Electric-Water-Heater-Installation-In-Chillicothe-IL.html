With sediment piling up on the bottom of your tank, your water heater is trying to heat water through the mound of dirt, leading to a longer wait time for your water to heat.

The basic gas heater installation requires the properly sized tankless water heater, venting components, extension of the hot and cold piping, an electrical connection and a gas connection.</p>

Water heaters come in two different styles: tank and tankless.</p>
