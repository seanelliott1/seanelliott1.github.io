<h2>Water Heater Services Sikeston Missouri</h2>
<p>If you have been considering buying a new water heater, you might have been told that you need a 50 gallon water heater if you have a family with 3 or 4 members in your household. Traditional water heaters can deliver as much hot water as the pipes will allow all at once. Broken pilot light: If you have a gas water heater, a lack of hot water may signal that its pilot light has gone out. Call the tankless water heater plumbers from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing today at (800) 259-7705 for help. The presence of puddles of water around the heater or water seeping down the sides of the heater are usually signs that the water heater tank may be fractured.</p>
<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we offer a solution that will meet your needs and conserve energy.

Keep in mind, there is always a direct relationship between the amount of power in and the output temperature of your hot water. This could be because the heating element itself needs to be replaced or because the power supply isn't reaching the element.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair Sikeston</h3>
<p>If the water coming out of your faucets is way too hot or it steams, it's possible that the water heater isn't shutting off at the temperature it's supposed to. This is probably because the temperature-pressure (TP) relief valve is malfunctioning. The most common complaint regarding a water heater is that it doesn't produce enough hot water. Our factory trained technicians provide 24 hour emergency service on all makes and models, and same day replacement with no charge for removal and disposal of your old water heater.</p>

If our water heater inspection determines that your unit has outlived its useful life or is damaged beyond economical repair, we may suggest a full water heater replacement.</p>
<p>The first thing you'll have to decide when looking at hot water heaters is what type of fuel source you want yours to use. The energy efficiency of water heaters is determined by the Energy Factor (EF) - a calculation of how much hot water the appliance produces versus how much fuel it consumes. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more economical.</p>

Electric water heaters look similar to their gas-fueled cousins.</p>
<p>Thanks to the low emission of potentially health-threatening elements tankless water heaters are environment-friendly. If your current hot water heater cannot meet your needs, new water heater installation is likely the best choice. Higher installation cost - You might run into a higher installation cost because of venting requirements, as well as the placement of additional tankless units around the home. If your existing hot water heater is good, just requiring maintenance, minor repairs, or new fittings, we can get you working again in no time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if the leaking is from the tank this is common sign that your water heater needs to be replaced. In this way, you can have hot water whenever you need it without paying to heat a full tank 24 hours a day.
