<p>Tankless heaters take up less space compared to the space of a 20 or 80-gallon tank. Single point tankless units can be installed on the interior or exterior of the building near the water use point and no more than 50 ft. from an adjacent power source (typically requiring 220 volts) if using an electric heater. Typically, tankless water heaters, which heat water only when you need it, cost more but can save about 25 percent of annual water heating costs, on average.</p>

<p>Noritz has been an innovator in the water heating industry for over 60 years. This way the cold water can flow back to the heater through the cold water line. Mr. Electric service professionals are trained and experienced in installing tankless water heaters. Tankless hot water heaters come in three different types : non-condensing, condensing, non-condensing hybrid. By only heating water when it's needed, tankless water heaters do not experience standby heat loss, which occurs when heat escapes the water tank and needs constant reheating.</p>
<p>But though electric units may use their fuel more efficiently, electricity is a much more expensive water-heating fuel than gas in most regions. With a conventional tank-type water heater there are many things that can and do go wrong, the least of which is the pilot light being extinguished for no apparent reason.

<p>Your water heater is leaking: Any type of water leak is no good, but it can be especially bad if the water is coming from your water heater. Most water heaters rely on a natural draft to draw combustion fumes up the flue. Turn off the cold water valve at the top of the heater. Disconnect the pipes and remove the water heater. Since everyone will have a slightly unique situation in reconnecting their water heater, let me just offer you some tips and lists that will help you to determine your best approach.</p>
<p>The word average” is important: it's possible that your current water heater is still going at age 20, or might quit at age 8. A lot of that is contextual, and could depend on usage, maintenance, and, yes, a bit of luck. This is when flushing the tank is necessary for a quick water heater repair. New installs require retrofit - Replacing your traditional water heater with a tankless hot water heater can be complicated and involve increased installation costs.</p>
