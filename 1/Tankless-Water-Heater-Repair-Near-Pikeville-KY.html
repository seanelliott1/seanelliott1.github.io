<h2>Water Heater Services Pikeville Kentucky</h2>
<p>Let's face it, unless you have invested in the new state-of-the-art tankless systems, water heaters take up a lot of space. The less water you use, the more efficient your tankless water heater will be. That's why these systems are ideal for vacation homes and families that use less water. Replaced 75 gallon electric water heater with rheem 75 gallon Marathon with a lifetime warranty. Most homeowners don't give much thought to the water heater until it goes out. Age - The serial number on the water heater should also contain the date of manufacture, which will give you the heater's age.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since tankless heaters do not have a tank, there is absolutely zero risk of an explosion ever occurring. Sometimes the hot water tank in the system is the only one used to provide the home with hot water—and many modern solar water tanks come with a built-in electric element for auxiliary heating when the sun isn't shining enough. In commercial settings, manifold systems link multiple tankless units together to dramatically increase their heating capacity while decreasing the individual load.</p>
<p>When the hot water is being taken from a tank, the tank will be filled up with cold water, which will cool the temperature of the water that is available. The water heater tank is damaged or rusted. One of the most vital plumbing components in your home is the water heater. You need someone you can rely on when you say, Fix my water heater!” At Davis Home Services, that's the type of service we want to give you every time.</p>

<p>The only bigger percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless water heaters are heaters which work dynamically, heating water up as you request it, so no energy gets wasted storing any heated water, there's no bulk since the tankless water heater is just a small box, and you'll have no difficulties concealing it under a sink or behind a piece of furniture for example.

<p>Even if a larger heater is available, there is always a size and weight consideration in an RV. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon, so even if you had room for a 20-30 gallon unit, the extra 80-200 pounds of water plus the weight of the bigger unit is usually a problem. The higher the EF number, the more efficiently the water heater uses its energy.
