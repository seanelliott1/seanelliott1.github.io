Whereas with a tankless hot water heater all you have to do is turn off the water supply to that location disconnect the supply lines and you are basically finished.</p>
<p>While replacing most hot water heater parts is fairly easy, it is not entirely without risk. One advantage is that since the tankless unit does not have a tank, there is no continuous heat (energy) loss from the large volume of stored heated water, as there is with a traditional storage type heater. Purchasing a tankless water heater will cost you a quite a bit more than a traditional water heater. With tankless water heaters, there is no more need for pipes running throughout your home, as they can be easily installed in your bathroom, kitchen, or garage, right at the point of use minimizing the associated piping.</p>

<p>Petersen Plumbing does not recommend tankless water heaters in locations with hard well water, or where galvanized steel pipe is present either in the building, or in the water service to the building. Capacity: The size of on-demand water heaters should be based on the number of occupants in the home and their peak hour water demand, rather than the size of the house. Units that undergo routine checks and upgrades last longer and undergo less frequent and costly repairs.</p>
<p>Tankless can also be a good choice for large families because you have more people consistently using more hot water. There are many reasons why these are much better than the tank heaters, but let's consider the most important reasons to switch over, money. If your water heater has rust-colored water or if your water heater leaks , let us know. The initial cost of a combination or integrated water and space heating system is going to cost you more than if you install a separate heater and furnace or boiler, but both installation and maintenance costs are probably going to be less.</p>
<p>Heaters with water tank normally consume lots of extra energy to keep the stored water warm, which in turn, cost higher for the operation. Your old water heater was probably D rated, whereas these new units are A rated and better for the environment. This is the kind of energy-saving customization that is impossible with tank-style water heaters. That may be enough to supply a whole house in areas with warm groundwater, but in colder climes they're better suited to point-of-use service, where the demand for hot water doesn't get too high.</p>

Knowing when your tankless water heater is malfunctioning or damaged will give you the knowledge to call for repairs at the right time.</p>
<p>If your water system has a check valve or anti-siphon valve on the supply line, an expansion tank near the cold intake to the heater will likely be necessary. Most smaller units are installed near the point of usage, usually on the wall. Overall, the tankless gas water heaters are not as dangerous to life as the comparable standard tank-type units, although nothing is ever 100% assured. Don't think that your heater will continue to function perfectly for many decades, regardless of how modern and expensive yours is.

Drain out a gallon of water from the water heater, so it's not completely full at the plumbing connections on top. You may have looked up videos about how to install a water heater yourself, but our team cautions strongly against trying to DIY anything related to water heaters—particularly ones fueled by natural gas.</p>
<p>It's also possible that some new code requirements have changed since your w. heater was first installed. With a range between $400 and $900, the average homeowner can expect to pay $650 to have a new water heater installed professionally. The right size unit can provide endless hot water for up to two major applications at a time. Standard water heaters can potentially build upscale and rust inside the tank over time, but a tankless unit gives you cleaner and fresh hot water all the time.</p>
