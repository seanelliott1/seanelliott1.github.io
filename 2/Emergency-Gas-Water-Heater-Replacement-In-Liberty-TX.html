Storage water heater: Life expectancy of 10-15 years and produces standby heat loss. When water heaters spring a leak, repair isn't an option. The cost of heating water consumes almost 20 percent of your household budget, second only to what you spend on heating and cooling your home.</p>
<p>Keep your water heater set to 120 degrees F as higher temperatures can increase sediment buildup in the tank.
