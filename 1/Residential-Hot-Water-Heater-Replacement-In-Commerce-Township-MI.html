<h2>Water Heater Services Commerce Township Michigan</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>Simply replacing an older water heater can reduce the energy you use to heat water by up to half and help you save money. A reduction in efficiency due to this build up is also a common gas water heater problem, but the big issue is that it blocks the anode protection. For electric ones, the heating element may need to be replaced if it is acting up. This is why it's crucial to act on any leaks you might notice with the water heater.</p>
<p>I need to purchase a new water heater SOON. Energy Saving: You'll notice the difference in your electricity bill since you don't have to heat up an entire tank of water. Your water heater's size is determined by how much warm water you use and what kind of heater you select. Other terms for Tankless are Combination, Combi Boilers, Continuous Flow, Inline, Flash, On-Demand or Instant-On Water heaters. Tankless water systems are popular for the simple reasons that tankless systems provide you with a virtually endless supply of hot water both where and when you need it. With old style tank systems, heated water can sit for long periods of time, generating hard-water scale and using costly energy to maintain water temperatures.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater Installation Commerce Township</h3>
<p>Directly connected to the water heater (no shut-off valve nor pressure reducer), it balances out the pressure inside the appliance. New equipment installations typically increase efficiency and help reduce the energy bills of our customers by only heating water when you call for it; unlike conventional water heaters that heat all the water in the tank at once. Too much hot water usage can deplete the tank's supply, meaning one unfortunate person gets left with a cold shower.</p>
<p>If your building inspector finds a non-direct vent heater installed in a confined space, you will probably be told to add 2 new penetrations through the wall (known as high-and-low venting) or you will be told to remove it until it conforms to the code requirements. Heating water amounts to nearly 20% of a home's energy costs, so making sure you have a reliable water heater helps you save energy and money.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, use high-powered burners to rapidly heat water as it runs through a heat exchanger and deliver it directly to your faucets or shower without storing it in a tank. Another reason that hot water customers prefer the tankless system is for safety purposes. Gas water heaters cost more to install than an electric water heater because of the need to either tap into an existing gas line or bring a gas line to that location ($500), and ventilation must be provided to remove the combustion fumes from the property into the outside air.</p>
<p>Water heater installation and replacement is a job best left to the professional plumbers at Roto-Rooter. If the heater bottom develops a leak the heater cannot be repaired. What people are really asking when they say are tankless water heaters worth it is how do the energy savings over the lifetime of the heater compare to the initial cost. Both gas and electric tankless water heaters need electricity to run. Since tankless water heaters don't maintain a supply of water in a corroding tank, the water they distribute throughout your home is more pure and safer on your skin.</p>

How a storage tank water heater works is actually a simple enough process. We are certified in all makes of tankless water heaters and can advise you of your options in completing repairs, performing routine maintenance, and replacing an old unit if needed. Since the system is connected directly to your plumbing and heats water as it passes through your pipes, you will never run out of hot water.</p>
<p>When the water temperature falls below a preset level, the unit engages, and the water is reheated. This covers fuel type, tank size, energy efficiency and which models are within your budget. DIY water heater installations can be costly and ineffective. Sometimes however you may not have to replace the entire unit, but call a plumbing contractor for your water heater repair if the leak originates from the top. Tankless heaters eliminate the need for storage tanks.</p>
<p>Overall, there are situations where a hot water tank is a better choice over a tankless water heater. Vents also need to be installed to ventilate the unit. Low maintenance: With no storage tank to drain, clean, and protect from corrosion, tankless water heaters require less maintenance, and may last longer than traditional storage-tank water heating equipment. Tankless water heater built with condensing technology has lower costs of installation.</p>

<p>Households that use more hot water, in any climate, may also find that when they ask are tankless water heaters worth it the answer is yes and no. This is because they will be using so much hot water that their heater is working just as much whether it is a tankless or a conventional. We'll answer all these questions so that you can have your hot water restored in no time. Changing from electric to gas or visa-versa could incur additional costs in venting, plumbing changes and even electrical.</p>
