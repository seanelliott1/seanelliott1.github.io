<p>Most DIYers try to make their own water heater repairs in an effort to save money. A tankless water heater installation really isn't all that complicated and there aren't too many parts that have to be purchased. Gas is more energy efficient and cheaper to run, but electric will not make a drastic difference.

<p>Continuous Hot Water: Because a tankless water heater heats the water as it's used and doesn't rely on a full tank of hot water, you're not limited by your tank's size. If you have a gas water heater, we verify that the flue is clear prior to making the final connections. We can help you maintain your new water heater, too, so you can be sure it will last for quite some time.

Professional installation avoids the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning, explosions, or fire with proper venting, gas lines, and wiring.</p>
<p>Low Capacity: The water heater that was originally installed in your home was not designed to keep up with a growing family and modern appliances. Many newer water heaters use a new electronic control valve called the Honeywell Smart Controller.

<p>From standard tank water heaters to tankless to solar water heaters, we have an option that will match your needs and save energy.
