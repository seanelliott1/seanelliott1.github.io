<h2>Water Heater Services Dixon California</h2>
<p>There are several reasons for and against installing an electric tankless water heater. No two brands of tankless heaters are exactly alike, and an improperly installed unit will more than likely underperform. Call (855) 982-2028 to schedule your water heater repair service. Having an incorrect setting can cause your water to be too cold, too hot, or cause your heating elements to work constantly. If your tank is gas powered, you'll find gas connections below the tank at the pilot light. The idea behind this type of water heater is to reduce wasted energy by heating the water as it runs through the pipe instead of keeping it in a tank and spending energy to keep it at one temperature twenty four hours a day.</p>
<p>It'll cost you anywhere from $300 to $2,000 for a hot water tank style heater. Depending on your location and other components, you have several choices for powering your new water heater. Some people say that tankless installation is more expensive, and for some this may be true. Drain the water from the tank and unscrew the old element using a heating element wrench. And that's not the only benefit they provide: they take up a lot less space, have a longer lifespan, save energy because they don't have to keep a tank full of water heated around the clock, and ultimately save you money in operating costs in the long run.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters (such as demand-type water heaters and tankless coil water heaters) prevent standby heat losses. When you multiply that usage by each household member, the demands placed on the water heater is brought into perspective. Small families and studio apartments can often use a 20 gallon electric or tankless water heater (if the apartments are on individual units). When it comes to water heaters, repair isn't always the most cost-effective option.</p>

<p>Natural gas units are the least expensive choice and are powered from a city utility supply which costs an average of $200 per year. Tankless gas water heaters have wider applications, as they supply hot water at higher flow rates.

<p>High energy bills - An old water heater may be working harder than it needs to and, in turn, raising your energy bills unnecessarily. Might not heat water to high enough temperature in winter, depending on required flow rate of water. To overcome this problem, you can install a whole house” type tankless water heater or install two or more tankless water heaters, connected in parallel for simultaneous demands of hot water.</p>
<p>Fuel type (electric vs. gas)- Gas tankless water heaters are usually more expensive to install than electric water heaters, but cost less to operate on a monthly basis. Another major reason for people electing a tankless system is avoidance of the "shower frigid dance." If you have ever been halfway through a shower and had the hot water give out, you know what I mean. Considering the many advantages over traditional tank-type units, it isn't hard to see why homeowners love tankless systems.</p>
