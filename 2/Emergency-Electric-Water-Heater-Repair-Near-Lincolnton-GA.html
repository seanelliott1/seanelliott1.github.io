Whether gas or electric, tankless water heaters heat water only as it is needed and may save up to 70 percent on a yearly heating bill. The tankless water heater heats the water when it is required. These traditional heaters can be exhausted and take a long time to refill and reheat.</p>
<p>When the water temperature falls below a preset level, the unit engages, and the water is reheated. This covers fuel type, tank size, energy efficiency and which models are within your budget. DIY water heater installations can be costly and ineffective.

You can get a low-end 50-gallon tank water heater for around $500 but a top-of-the-line Rinnai or Navien may cost around $1,500. Your water heater does not supply hot water constantly. With fewer components and no bulky water tank, you will require fewer repairs and your unit will last about 5-10 years longer than a traditional unit. Storage tank water heaters store 40 to 120 gallons of water at a time and constantly reheat that water regardless of how much is actually demanded.</p>
<p>Because electric power is more expensive than gas, these units are better suited for smaller jobs. New water heaters tend to be far more energy-efficient, so they can cut energy costs; homeowners may also be eligible for a new water heater rebate from their local utility company. Some electric tankless water heaters, like products from EcoSmart, are self-regulating, and instead of always applying the most power to heat the water, they only apply the amount of power needed for the actual demand at that time, and that makes them a lot more efficient.</p>
