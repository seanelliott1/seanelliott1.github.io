<h2>Water Heater Services South Portland Maine</h2>
<p>The water heater is an immensely important fixture in your house. You can try raising the temperature on the water heater, as discussed directly above. Once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting, the top thermostat (is considered "satisfied") switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat. We can help guide you through these and help you choose the hot water heater that will best match your needs for hot water output while maximizing the efficiency of the utility source from which it runs.</p>
<p>Whether your current system is outdated or you need water heater installation for new construction, we carry top-of-the-line products and provide timely, affordable service throughout Chicago and the surrounding region. Traditional water heaters are constantly warming water throughout the day, even when you're not using it. Tankless units only heat what you need, efficiently, helping you save on costs. Most tankless water heaters burn either natural gas or propane fuel.</p>
<p>If LPG gas installation is required, including gas bottle installation, LPG installation cost would be in the $250 to $500 range, depending on the lengths of the pipe runs. The energy efficiency of the boiler or hot water tank storage system comes from the dual use, which reduces standing water heat loss and offsets electric energy use with natural gas. We perform all the water heater services you need, from installing a high-efficiency unit to keeping the appliance up and running for years to come.</p>
