This is largely due to the increased amount of energy required to operate a tankless heater when it's in use. Some state laws require replacement water heaters to be anchored or braced to resist movement during an earthquake, which can cause gas or water line leaks and electrical wiring damage. If your household consumes a great deal of hot water and needs it from more than one outlet at a time then don't purchase a standard tankless water heater.</p>
<p>If you're using a gas-powered water heater, the burner assembly must be connected to the gas line. This is because the heating coils are in the pipes and ready to heat the water as soon as it is needed. This means, if you're running the dishwasher, doing the laundry, and taking a shower simultaneously, your heater may not be able to produce hot water fast enough.

If you aren't comfortable working with gas or electricity, do yourself a favor and call a professional plumber.</p>
