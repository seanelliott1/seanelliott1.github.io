<h2>Water Heater Services Albany Kentucky</h2>
<p>When it comes to do it yourself projects around the house, you can save a bundle of money over having someone else do the work for you. Tankless water heaters provide hot water right when you need it. By heating cold water directly, you don't have to wait for hot water to fill the tank. Tankless water heaters are rated to produce specific levels of heat. When you encounter a problem with your water heater, you aren't able to do any of these things, and that's a major disruption to your life. Payback time was longer for a tankless unit that replaced an existing storage tank but more reasonable with new construction.</p>
<p>A 2-gallon expansion tank works with water heaters up to 50 gallons. The build-up of excess sediment inside your water tank may cause it to heat a lower volume of H2O. Multiple units can be plumbed in parallel to increase the volume output of hot water. 2. Tankless water heaters deliver hot water faster. Because tankless models can deliver better performance and energy efficiency - that's why. We are the most trusted HVAC contractor, providing professional water heater installation and repair services.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Albany Kentucky 42602</h3>
<p>When it comes to a gas water heater repair, pilot light issues are the most common because if the pilot light goes out, the water heater isn't going to work. An aluminum or magnesium probe inside the tank, it collects corrosive elements and should be replaced when caked or eaten away. Units last longer - Tankless water heaters have a lifespan of about 20 years compared to 10 for a standard water heater. We repair and install all types of tankless heaters.</p>
<p>The gas tankless water heater installation cost would be in the $1200 to $3000 range if switching from electric to gas. The tankless unit also uses a PVC flue pipe, which can be installed when a standard chimney is either not available or not practical. Water heaters are not products that are meant to last for a lifetime, thus, there are times in which your water heater will need to be repaired. At PV, we perform high quality, professionally audited installations of natural gas tankless water heaters.</p>
<p>If your water system has a check valve or anti-siphon valve on the supply line, an expansion tank near the cold intake to the heater will likely be necessary. Most smaller units are installed near the point of usage, usually on the wall. Overall, the tankless gas water heaters are not as dangerous to life as the comparable standard tank-type units, although nothing is ever 100% assured. Don't think that your heater will continue to function perfectly for many decades, regardless of how modern and expensive yours is. Hot water heater can go for many years without needing repair, but they always eventually malfunction and need fixing or replacing.</p>
<p>If you are sure you have power, the problem is either your heating elements or thermostats. We want you to feel comfortable with us and confident you'll receive great service and excellent value for all your plumbing, heating and air conditioning needs. A functioning hot water heater is necessary for things like showers, dishes, and laundry. Second: tankless water heaters use a lot less energy than storage tank water heaters.</p>
<p>These units can heat between 20 to 100 gallons of water. With this type of water heater, a huge amount of hot water can heated as needed instead of storing it in a tank. As such, rather than limiting your business's capabilities to the capacities of your storage tanks, a tankless water heater provides you with an infinite supply of hot water. But if the heater is already too old, and leakage is impossible to repair, then this will definitely mean replacement.</p>
