<h2>Water Heater Services Emporia Kansas</h2>
<p>Did you know that water heater problems are one of the most common reasons to call a plumber? In a point of use water heater, there is no tank involved. If the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat's setting, the lower thermostat remains "off" and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element. Water heaters are an integral part of every home, and no matter what kind you have, proper installation and maintenance will keep your home running smoothly.</p>
<p>Tankless units have an average lifespan about twice that of conventional water heaters — 20 years or more. Call us today to schedule service for your water heater. One very good way of increasing the efficiency of your gas heater is by adding an insulation jacket. For all water heaters, life expectancy will depend on local variables such as water chemistry and homeowner maintenance.” For the purpose of this example, we'll assume both the tankless water heater and the storage water heater will each last 15 years.</p>
<p>Water in the storage tank is either heated by a pilot burner or an electrically heated element inside the tank, much like an electric thermos. They also provide an endless supply of hot water since they instantly heat water on demand. While these systems are less prone to wear than hot water heaters with tanks, they do break down over time. Your Blind & Sons plumber will perform a capacity test to determine the right size water heater for your home.</p>
