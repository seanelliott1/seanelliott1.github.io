<h3>Local Tankless Water Heater Repair Eaton</h3>
<p>A hot water heater is the thirty to fifty gallon tank tactfully closeted in your kitchen, bathroom, or some other well-concealed space. In water heater tanks, one of the most common problems is corrosion. Hot water heaters work hard day in, day out — until they don't. Only heats water when you need it, so energy isn't wasted for hot water that's not needed right away. Many people try to cut water usage in an effort to reduce this lost energy, but they don't realize that the heat is still generated throughout the day, whether or not they actually use the hot water in the tank.</p>
<p>All hot water storage tanks include a critical safety feature: the temperature and pressure valve, which is often referred to as the T&P valve If the water gets too hot or the pressure in the tank is too high, the T&P valve will open and deposit water through a pipe running outside of the tank that usually ends 6 inches above the ground. The higher the flow rate, the more expensive the tankless unit. The valve at the top is a safety release valve that will open if the pressure or heat inside the tank rises above normal.</p>
<p>Get your water heater flushed out regularly to keep it running well. The only greater percentage is heating and cooling costs. Tankless units only operate when you need hot water, thereby reducing energy consumption and costs by up to 35%. This gets to one of my colleague's concerns: how long it takes for a tankless water heater to deliver hot water to its final destination. Upgrading to an energy efficient water heater will save a great deal of money over the life of the unit.</p>
<p>Conventional hot water heaters keep water in storage tanks at a set temperature and distribute hot water on an as-needed basis. Replace your standard water heater with an electric fired tankless water heater. Normally, gas-type water heater last up to 12 years. Hot water temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit can cause serious burns. If installed properly, your tankless water heater should not require much maintenance and can run for twice as long as a conventional storage (tank) water heater.</p>
