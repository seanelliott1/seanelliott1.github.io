The main advantage of tankless models is that they only heat the water when you need it, so they don't waste energy keeping the water warm around the clock.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the water heater isn't heating water, the electrical elements inside it are not getting hot. If your hot water tank is over 15 years old, it's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one. You expect the best for your home, family and business, so it makes sense to trust the #1 selling gas tankless water heating brand in North America for all of your water heating needs.</p>
