<h2>Water Heater Services Santa Barbara California</h2>
<p>Repair guides and support for gas and electric hot water tanks, boilers and household heat exchangers. With all this in mind, it's generally better to let an expert install your tankless water heater. If you start to hear rumbling from your water heater, keep an eye out for any small leaks. Keep in mind, however, that most conventional gas tank water heaters were not installed with a tankless retrofit in mind. We install new water heaters here in Natchitoches. A new energy-efficient water heater will help save you some money in energy costs each month.</p>
<p>Replacing a water heater usually costs $500 to $1,800 for a replacement of the same style and size. Another feature for the tankless water heater is a unit with an increased flow rate. The greater the desired Temperature Rise, the less Gallons per Minute of hot water can be produced. Our team of professionals is highly trained, knowledgeable, and experienced in all water heater installations and repairs. Such installation may result in an explosion or fire, but sometimes there may be no other choices.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters also known as Instant hot water heaters, do not store water. You may want to have another gas shutoff valve installed just prior to the unit being installed. If your plumbing or electrical system requires upgrading to permit the use of a tankless heater it can be extremely expensive. Water heaters are not simple appliances. This can add to the your water heater cost. This means that it will take much longer for your water to get hot while you run the faucet waiting for it. It's pretty clear that this will cause an increase in water being run down the drain, costing the home owner money, wasting one of our most precious resources.</p>
<h3>Local Hot Water Heater Replacement Santa Barbara</h3>
<p>At Epic Plumbing, we specialize in tankless water heater services to benefit our customers for the long haul. Changing to a tankless system like the Tempra® eliminates these problems and results in typical savings of at least 15 - 20% on the hot water portion of your electric bill. Never attempt to do it without first reading all the instructions that can with your particular tankless water heater. While you can help prolong the life of your water heater with annual maintenance, chances are you'll need to have the pre-existing tank replaced with a new one if you occupy a given residence for more than eight years.</p>
<p>Whether you are doing multiple loads of laundry or using the shower multiple times a day, a tankless water heater means you'll constantly be provided with the hot water your household needs. Present day water heaters are constructed to require little to no maintenance, but many issues can be avoided with regular check-ups. In most cases, a plumber will install a water heater in a day (6-8 hours). A lot of homeowners choose a tank-type water heater - a large, cylindrical tank standing on end with pipes attached to it.</p>
<p>Instead, they have a heating system that allows for on-demand hot water. The biggest trend currently is tankless water heaters. If you choose to proceed with a new water heater installation, we offer financing options to ease the upfront cost burden. A tankless hot water heater is a heating element installed near the point of use. Some may include a specific exclusion to water damage from water heaters or burst pipes — so it's useful to learn when your policy is applicable.</p>
<p>Not every house or business is going to use the same energy source to run their appliances, which is why it's so great that tankless water heaters can either be electric or gas. However, it is not recommended that you try to do this on your own, as there is power running to these water heaters, which does increase your chance of electrical shock. Instead of storing hot water, a tankless unit heats the water as it is delivered to the faucet or showerhead.</p>

<p>If it's time for a replacement, we will help you determine the best option according to the design of your home and your family's needs and budget.

We have an excellent selection of tank and tankless models that meet the government's energy-efficiency standards.</p>
<p>There are situations where your heater could break before it is old, however, and in these scenarios we might try repairing it.

<p>On the other hand, Gas or propane fueled tankless water heaters have better power efficient but more complex installation process. A tankless water heater system operates by using a line or pipe. Instead, heating elements are used that heat the water as it is needed. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models). Whether you choose gas or electric, there are many ways to get savings out of a tankless hot water heater.</p>
