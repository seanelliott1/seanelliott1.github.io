<h2>Water Heater Services Dorchester Center Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of replacing your gas tank-style unit with a tankless model, you should consider an outdoor installation. An electric water heater has an upper and a lower heating element. Storage tank: Storage tank water heaters typically have a capacity of 30 to 60 gallons, but the most common size is 50 gallons. The disadvantage with this tankless gas heater is that it takes a few seconds before hot water starts flowing. You don't know how old the water heater is or when it was last serviced. If all of these advantages sound good to you, call us today at 423-718-7342 for tankless water heater installation services.</p>
<p>If there weren't a dip tube the incoming cold water would constantly be cooling down the heated water and you would think that something is wrong with the heater because you are quickly running out of hot water. Each hot water heater comes with a digital control pad that allows you to control the water temperature for various water outlets in your home or business. There are many different types of water heaters on the market.</p>
<p>If you live in a warm or temperate climate, where the groundwater temperature is always above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be able to run one main hot water fixture (a shower, bath, dishwasher, washing machine or kitchen sink), and a bathroom sink at the same time. While this is not something that people are too happy about, it is so important to get a replacement for your water heater when it is needed.</p>
<h3>Emergency Tankless Water Heater Installation Dorchester Center</h3>
<p>If your water comes out smelling like rotten eggs, there could be bacteria in the hot water heater tank. In our Chicago climate we experience extremely cold weather that can occasionally cause a main water line or incorrectly installed tankless water heater to freeze and prevent water from flowing. However, tankless water heaters are more energy efficient because you're only heating water as you need it. A water heater with a tank needs energy to heat up to 100 gallons, for example, and then needs energy to keep it hot all day long or until it's used.</p>
<p>The cost difference between a traditional water heater and a tankless water heater usually shows the tankless option for a whole house water heater being 2 to 3 times more expensive. Our water heater team offers all water heater services, including 24-hour emergency repairs and replacements. Defective water can heaters consume a lot of gas and electricity, so you'll save quite a bit of cash by upgrading to an Energy Star-qualified model.</p>

<h3>Water Tank Repair Dorchester Center Massachusetts 02124</h3>
<p>Typically, water heaters that are over 10 years old need replacement, but with annual maintenance you may be able to prolong the water heater's life to 15 or 20 years. They cost more up front than standard electric models, but use about 60% less energy, meaning homeowners tend to see a return on their investment in the form of lower energy bills. If it's time to replace your conventional water heater with something better, a tankless unit might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>In some cases, the cost of water heater repair can help you determine whether it's a smarter financial move to opt for new hot water heater installation over repairing the existing unit. They can be installed in a closet or watershed for convenience. Be sure to ask our plumbers about our detailed water leak detection services and avoid an emergency. Lakewood Plumbing and Heating is a Certified Plumbing and Heating Service and installation contractor.</p>
<p>You may also need to wire in the new water heater unless you're lucky enough to have a properly sized power source nearby. After completing all the connections, the final step is to connect the new water heater to the power supply. Our tankless Installation price includes the job from start to finish along with the removal of old equipment and materials. Next if your heater came with a T&P valve unbox it and pipe dope those threads.</p>
<p>The largest gas models, which may provide all the needs of an entire household, are usually installed centrally. Water heaters are an integral part of the plumbing systems in residential homes and commercial buildings. Heaters are used for not only space heating, but cooking, cleaning, and showering as well. Considering the benefit of a warranty replacement when the water heater is 4-5 years old with a 6 yr. warranty, the customer should really consider if this is a wise choice or if at that point, they should simply purchase a new water heater and obtain the full warranty protection of the new water heater.</p>
<p>A 50 gallon conventional gas storage water heater cost approximately $600, a high-efficiency gas storage water heater cost approximately $650.00 and a 9.4 GPM whole-home tankless gas water heater cost approximately $1200.00. According to CostHelper , the installation cost of a storage water heater may be as low as $200 and the installation cost for a tankless water heater may be as low as $1000. If your water heater isn't working, trust South Jersey Energy Service Plus for the emergency repair solution.</p>
